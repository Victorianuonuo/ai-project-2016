The  leg-control  algorithm  provided  v e r t i c al 
legs  adaptation  to  small-scale  t e r r a in  rough(cid:173)
ness. 

A  special  block  was  designed  for  synthe(cid:173)
sizing  l e g - t ip  motion  during  the  swing  phase 
in  the  case  of  complicated  small-scale  r e(cid:173)
l i e f.  The  ordinates  of  the  l e g - t ip  t r a j e c t o(cid:173)
ry  (Fig.  3)  were  calculated  as  the  sum  of 
the  ordinates  of  the  convex  envelope  of  the 
r e l i ef  (dashed  l i ne  in  F i g.  3)  and  of  the 
ordinates  of  a  parabola  with  v e r t i c al  a x i s. 
The  parabola  was  chosen  in  such  a  way  that 
i tB  ordinates  were  equal  to  zero  both  in  the 
i n i t i al  and  f i n al  points. 
that  the  horizontal  component  of  the  l e g - t ip 
velocity  was  constant  during  the  whole  swing 
phase. 

It  was  assumed 

For  the  second  l e v el  of  leg  coordination

prescribed  s t a b i l i ty  margin  was  designed  in 
a  general  case  f or  i r r e g u l ar  standpoint  se(cid:173)
quence . 

Two  types  of  gait  were  investigated: 
1.  Tripod  g a i t.  Each  of  the  two  tripods 
consists  of  foreleg  and  hind  leg  of  one  size 
and  of  middle  leg  of  another  size.  Three 
legs  of  the  t r i p od  swing  simultaneously.Two 
tripods  swing  a l t e r n a t e l y.  F i g.  4a  i l lu  -
strates  the  adopted  logics  of  calculating 
"up"  and  "down"  times  of  the  t r i p od  in  the 
case  when  a ll  legs  of  the  same  side  use  the 
same  standpoint  sequence  ("step-in-step" 
type  of  locomotion).  The  swing  phase  of  the 
t r i p od  coincides  with  the  time  i n t e r v al  when 
the  projection  of  the  centre  of  mass  of  the 
walker  moves  between  two  dashed  lines  inside 
the  supporting  t r i a n g le  formed  by  the  legs 
of  the  other  t r i p od  (Fig.  4a).  This  logics 
provides  s t a b i l i ty  margin  of  prescribed  va(cid:173)
l u e. 

2.  Wave  g a i t .18  The  idea  of  t h is  type 

of  gait  was  taken  from  one  of  the  enthomolo-
g i c al  papers  by  D.  Wilson.14  The  swing  waves 
propagate  along  the  legs  of  each  side  of  the 
walker  beginning  from  the  hind  legs.  The 
hind  legs  of  both  sides  start  a l t e r n a t e l y. 
Support  scheduling  logics  is  shown  in 
F i g.  4b,  The  time  i n t e r v al  between  the  s t a rt 
of  the  hind  leg  and  the  standing  of  the  fo-
releg  (wave  propagation  time)  was  calculated 
under  condition  of  prescribed  s t a b i l i ty  mar(cid:173)
g i n.  Two  equal  intervals  of  simultaneous 
support  of  hind  and  middle  legs,  and  of  mid(cid:173)
dle  and  f r o nt  legs  were  subtracted  from  the 
wave  propagation  time.  The  rest  of  the  time 
was  devided  among  three  legs  proportional 
to  t h e ir  strides  (the  r u le  of  constant 
l e g-
t ip  horizontal  v e l o c i t y. 

It  should  be  noted  that  in  special  case 
of  regular  standpoint  sequence  the  gaits  ge(cid:173)
nerated  both  by  wave  and  by  t r i p od  algo(cid:173)
rithms  may  coincide.  But  in.  general  case  of 
i r r e g u l ar  standpoint  sequence  algorithms 
synthesize  d i f f e r e nt  g a i t s. 

The  designed  algorithms  of  t h is  l e v el 

generated  support  schedule  f or  both  cons(cid:173)
tant  and  variable  v e l o c i ty  of  the  body  in 
general  case  of  curve  route.  The  body  r o t a(cid:173)
t i on  and  the  v e r t i c al  component  of  body  ve(cid:173)
l o c i ty  might  be  taken  i n to  consideration. 

318 

On  the  t h i rd  l e v el  two  versions  of 

standpoint  planning  algorithms  were  designed 
which  were  able  to  generate  standpoint  se(cid:173)
quences  f or  a r b i t r a ry  curve  route  on  the  sup(cid:173)
port  surface  with  small-scale  roughness. 
It 
was  assumed  that  each  point  of  the  surface 
might  be  used  as  a  standpoint. 

Some  algorithms  were  designed  f or  gene(cid:173)

r a t i ng  special  i r r e g u l ar  standpoint  sequen(cid:173)
ces  in  case  of  overcoming  obstacles. 

The  f o u r t h - l e v el  algorithms  formed  body 

motion  f or  curve  route  under  the  above  men(cid:173)
tioned  condition  r e l a t i ve  to  the  support 
surface.  Some  cased  of  overcoming  obstacles 
were  considered. 

F i g.  5  presents  an  example  of  the  walk(cid:173)
e r 's  locomotion  along  the  curve  route.  The 
vehicle  moved  at  f i r st  along  the  r e c t i l i n e ar 
segment  AB.  Then,  at  point  B, 
it  changed  i ts 
route  and  began  walking  along  the  c i r c le  of 
the  prescribed  radius  around  the  object  l o(cid:173)
cated  inside  the  c i r c le  (part  BOB).  At  point 
B  the  walker  continued  i ts  previous  route 
(segment  BD). 

The  problem  of  overcoming  isolated  ob(cid:173)
stacles  of  some  types  was  investigated.  An 
obstacle  may  be  considered  as  an  isolated 
one  when  it  is  located  on  the  support  sur(cid:173)
face  a ll  points  of  which  might  be  used  as 
standpoints.  For  some  obstacles  it  appears 
undesirable  or  impossible  to  use  points  of 
the  support  surface  in  the  v i c i n i ty  of  the 
obstacle  due  to  geometrical  r e s t r i c t i o ns 
associated  with  the  neighbourhood  of  the  ob(cid:173)
stacle. 

Some  types  of  isolated  obstacles  are 

shown  in  F i g.  6.  One-parameter  obstacle 
" c l e f t"  (Fig.  6a) 
is  f u n c t i o n a l ly  equivalent 
to  the  domain  forbidden  f or  standing  the  legs. 
There  are  no  geometrical  r e s t r i c t i o ns  in  the 
v i c i n i ty  of  the  " c l e f t ". 

Two-parameter  obstacle  "boulder"  (Fig. 
6b),  on  the  contrary,  creates  two  r e s t r i c t ed 
spots  close  to  i t.  The  spot  before  the  boul(cid:173)
der  is  undesirable  because  of  the  p o s s i b i l i(cid:173)
ty  of  contacting  the  boulder  in  the  support 
phase.  The  body  of  the  boulder  may  make  it 
impossible  to  stand  leg  t ip  in  the  spot  be(cid:173)

it 
is  even  desirable. 

is  permissible  to 

It 

The  bottom  of  the  three-parameter  ob(cid:173)
stacle  " p i t"  (Fig.  6c)  may  be  used  to  stand 
legs  on  it  except  two  spots  near  the  w a l l s. 
It  should  be  noted  that  " c l e f t ",  " b o u l(cid:173)
der"  and  " p i t"  from  the  geometrical  point  of 
view  may  be  regarded  as  a  combination  of 
more  simple  obstacles  of  the  types  "step-
i n"  and  "step-down"  ( F i g.  6d,  e ). 
If  the 
longitudinal  dimensions  of  the  upper  part 
of  the  boulder  or  these  of  the  p it  bottom 
are  large  enough,  the  boulder  and  the  p it 
may  be  interpreted  as  two  separate  isolated 
obstacles  of  the  "step"  type. 
If  the  "steps" 
are  positioned  rather  close  one  a f t er  ano(cid:173)
ther, 
there  exists  interference  between 
them,  and  it  i s,  apparently,  more  reasonable 
to  t r e at  such  a  combination  as  a  special 
type  of  obstacle  with  i ts  own  special  method 
of  overcoming. 

It  was  assumed  that  the  measurement  sys(cid:173)
tem  was  able  to  estimate  the  distance  between 
the  f i x ed  point  of  the  vehicle  and  the  point 
of  intersection  of  the  measuring  beam  and  the 
support  surface.  The  direction  of  the  beam 
may  be  constant.  When  the  vehicle  walkes,  the 
beam  slides  over  the  t e r r a in  and  measures  i ts 
p r o f i l e.  But  this  may  be  i n s u f f i c i e n t.  The 
angle  between  the  beam  and  horizon  must  be 
small  enough  for  the  vehicle  could  get  t e r(cid:173)
r a in  r e l i ef  information  beforehand  and  has 
p o s s i b i l i ty  of  planning  i ts  actions  in  a  rea(cid:173)
sonable  way.  On  the  other  hand, 
it  is  clear 
that  f or  small  beam-horizon  angle  rather  long 
zones  after  obstacles  are  inaccessible  to  r e(cid:173)
l i ef  measurements.  The  increasing  of  the 
beam-horizon  angle  diminishes  the  inaccessible 
zones  but  diminishes  simultaneously  the  d i s(cid:173)
tance  between  the  vehicle  and  the  measured 
points  of  the  t e r r a i n. 

Under  the  circumstances  it  was  reaso(cid:173)

nable  to  control  the  beam  direction  f or  more 
effective  use  of  measurement  system.  One  of 
the  adopted  rules  was  as  follows.  A ll  the 
time  when  it  is  possible,  some  "small"  beam-
horizon  constant  angle  is  used.  This  regime 
is  used  as  long  as  the  size  of  inaccessible 
zones  is  no  more  than  a  given  value  and  each 
zone  can  be  "overstepped",  i . e.  overcomed 
without  placing  any  standpoint  inside  the 
zone. 
the  additional  measurements 
must  be  carried  out  when  approaching  nearer 
to  the  obstacle.  The  measuring  beam  must  be 
inclined  steeper  to  horizon.

The  investigation  carried  out  confirmed 
that  observing  on  the  display  screen  the  mo(cid:173)

properties.  The  motion  picture  made  from  the 
CRT  screen  of  the  display  unit  gives  an  idea 
of  the  walker  control  algorithms  e f f e c t i v e(cid:173)
ness. 

Some  algorithms  were  designed  f or  deci(cid:173)
sion-making  concerning  the  reasonable  a c t i(cid:173)
ons  of  the  walker  overcoming  the  obstacle. 
It  was  assumed  that  a ll  necessary  i n f o r m a t i(cid:173)
on  about  the  type  and  geometrical  parameters 
of  the  obstacle  are  available  and  may  be 
used  by  decision-making  algorithm. 

As  to  the  methods  of  overcoming  obsta(cid:173)
cles,  the  basic  p r i n c i p le  was  assumed  that 
the  higher  l e v el  might  be  involved  only  in

means  of  l e v el  " l e g ",  t h is  must  be  done. 
If

The  algorithms  for  overcoming  the  c l e f t-
type  obstacle  were  designed  in  greater  details 
A  special  c l a s s i f i c a t i on  block  estimated  the 
s i t u a t i o n:  standpoint  sequence  parameters, 
c l e ft  width  and  i ts  p o s i t i on  r e l a t i ve  to  the 
walker.  Depending  on  the  s i t u a t i on  analysis 
results  the  following  decisions  about  the 
regime  could  be  made: 

1.  Nothing  has  to  be  changes. 
2.  It 

is  necessary  to  make  longer  one 
stride  before  the  c l e ft  by  changing  the  po(cid:173)
s i t i on  of  two  standpoints  and  s h i f t i ng  them 
in  such  a  way  that  one  of  them, 
the  nearest 
to  the  c l e f t,  would  be  positioned  on  the 
b r i n k.  The  f u r t h er  development  of  standpoint 
sequence  may  be  regular,  as  before  the  c l e f t. 

3.  It 

is  necessary  to  position  four 

standpoints  on  the  brinks  of  the  c l e ft  (two 
on  each  b r i n k)  and  to  rearrange  some  other 
standpoints. 

4.  To  apply  regime  3  but  to  s h i ft 

standpoints  on  the  brink  closer  to  the  axis 
of  the  standpoint  sequence. 

5.  The  body  of  the  walker  must  be  low(cid:173)

ered,  and  regime  4  must  be  applied. 

The  standpoint  sequences  in  F i g.  7  cor(cid:173)

respond  to  regime  2,  while  those  in  F i g.  8 
correspond  to  regimes  4  and  5. 

The  regimes  1-5  are  l i s t ed  in  order  of 
growth  of  t h e ir  complicacy  and  t h e ir  f e a s i-
b i l i t i e s.  According  to  the  basic  p r i n c i p le 
the  c l a s s i f i c a t i on  block  t r i ed  to  f i nd  out 
subsequently  the  p o s s i b i l i ty  to  use  regimes 
1-5,  beginning  from  regime  I,  and  adopted 
the  f i r st  of  them  which  provided  successful 
overcoming  the  c l e f t. 

Such  an  approach  is  evidently  a p p l i(cid:173)
cable  to  designing  reasonable  methods  of 
overcoming  other  types  of  obstacles. 
It 
should  be  noted  that  for  a  p it  rather  deep, 
or  f or  a  boulder  rather  high,  or  f or  an  ob(cid:173)

change  i ts  p i t ch  angle  in  an  appropriate  way 
It  is 
as  a  function  of  time  (Fig.  9,  10). 
evident  that  when  analysing  the  obstacle, 
t h is  regime,  as  the  most  complicated  one, 
has  to  be  tested  in  the  last  t u r n. 

Some  problems  connected  with  measure(cid:173)
ments  were  investigated:  measurement  data 
processing,  obstacle  i d e n t i f i c a t i o n,  measu(cid:173)
