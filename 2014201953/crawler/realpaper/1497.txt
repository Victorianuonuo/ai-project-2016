MS. MALAPROP, A LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION PROGRAM 

Eugene  Charniak

Abstract 

This  paper  describes  Ms.  Malaprop,  a  program  (cur(cid:173)
rently  being  designed)  which  will  answer  questions 
about  simple  stories  dealing  with  painting,  where 
stories,  questions  and  answers  will  be  expressed 
in  semantic  representation  rather  than  English  in 
order  to  allow  concentration  on  the  inferential 
problems  involved  in  language  comprehension.  The 
common  sense  knowledge  needed  to  accomplish  the 
task  is  provided  by  the  frame  representation  of 
"mundane"  painting  found  in  Charniak  (1976b).  The 
present  paper,  after  reviewing  this  representation, 
goes  on  to  describe  how  it  is  used  by  Ms.  Malaprop. 
Some  specific  questions  of  matching,  correcting 
false  conclusions,  and  search,  will  be  discussed.

Introduction 

For  the  purpose  of  this  paper,  I  take  language  com(cid:173)
prehension  to  be  the  process  of  f i t t i ng  what  one 
is  told  into  the  framework  established  by  what  one 
already  knows.  So,  to  take  a  simple  example, 
(1)  Jack  was  going  to  paint  a  chair.  He  started 

to  clean  i t. 

our  understanding  of  the  second  line  of  (1)  is  con(cid:173)
ditioned  by  two  facts:  the  f i r st  is  the  story  spe(cid:173)
cific  information  provided  by  the  f i r st  line,  i.e., 
that  Jack  has  the  intention  of  painting  the  chair, 
while  the  second  comes  from  our  general  fund  of 
common  sense  knowledge  and  states  that  it  is  a  good 
idea  if  the  thing  to  be  painted  is  clean  before  one 
starts.  By  tying  the  second  line  to  such  informa(cid:173)
tion  a  person,  or  computer,  would  "know"  such  rela(cid:173)
ted  facts  as  why  the  action  was  performed,  what 
might  have  happened  if  it  hadn't  been,  and  how  far 
along  Jack  is  in  the  process  of  painting  the  chair. 

seeing  how  it  relates  to  some  complex  plot  sup(cid:173)
plied  in  the  story.  This  is  obviously  unrealistic 
as  far  as  stories  go,  but  it  is  all  too  realistic 
given  current  understanding  of  language  compre(cid:173)
hension. 

This  example  is  also  typical  insofar  as  once  we 
have  seen  the  second  line  as  an  instance  of  a 
certain  portion  of  the  painting  process,  the  ty(cid:173)
pical  questions  one  might  ask  to  demonstrate  un(cid:173)
derstanding,  such  as  "why"  or  "what  would  have 
happened  if  he  hadn't",  should  not  be  too  d i f f i(cid:173)
cult  to  answer.  Hence  I  shall  ignore  the  problem 
of  how  questions  actually  get  answered  in  order 
to  concentrate  on  the  problems  of  the  initial 
integration  which  I  will  assume  occurs  at  "read 
time"  rather  than  "question  time".  (For  discussion 
of  this  assumption,  see  Charniak  (1976a).) 

No  example  is  completely  typical  however  and  one 
thing  (1)  does  not  indicate  is  that  Ms.  Malaprop, 
at  least  in  her  early  versions,  will  not  under(cid:173)
stand  English,  but  rather  will  be  given  stories 
and  questions  already  in  semantic  representation. 
This  representation  has  been  almost  entirely 
designed  (see  Charniak  (1976b))  but,  except  in 
those  places  where  it  is  the  topic  of  discussion, 
it  will  be  replaced  by  English  phrases  throughout. 

Also,  while  many  of  the  examples  which  are  being 
used  to  define  Ms.  Malaprop's  capabilities  are 
like  (1)  in  that  they  call  for  the  program  to  tell 
you  what  in  some  sense  it  already  knows,  other 
examples  are  considerably  more  complex.  For  exam(cid:173)
ple  :  "After  Jack  finished  he  did  not  wash  the 
paint  brush.  He  was  going  to  throw  it  away.  Ques(cid:173)
tion  :  Why  didn't  Jack  wash  the  brush  ?" 

I  should  note  that  the  foreseen  f i r st  version  of 
the  program  will  handle  all  of  the  painting  exam(cid:173)
ples  herein,  given  the  caveat,  repeated  here  for 
the  last  time,  that  Ms.  Malaprop  cannot  handle 
actual  English. 

I I.  The  Framed  Painting 

Ms.  Malaprop  is  a  computer  program  (currently  being 
designed)  which  will  answer  questions  about  exam(cid:173)
ples  such  as  (1).  Indeed  (1)  is  a  typical  example 
in  many  respects.  For  one  thing  it  stays  quite  close 
to  our  knowledge  of  everyday  events.  As  such  the 
story  specific  information  serves  only  to  tell  the 
program  which  parts  of  its  real  world  knowledge 
are  relevant  to  the  story  situation;  the  story  does 
not  build  up  a  complex  setting  of  its  own.  Hence 
when  Ms.  Malaprop  f i ts  new  story  information  into 
what  she  knows  it  is  always  by  relating  it  to  her 
store  of  common  sense  knowledge,  and  never  by 

Evidently,  a  program  which  answers  such  questions 
will  have  to  have  at  its  disposal  quite  a  bit  of 
information  about  painting  and  its  neighbouring 
concepts.  This  knowledge  base  is  completely  desi(cid:173)
gned  and  is  described  in  detail  in  Charniak 
(1976b).  We  can  only  give  a  brief  overview  here, 
but  it  should  be  stressed  that  this  representation 
is  a)  completely  formalized,  b)  fairly  complete, 
and  c)  fairly  deep.  By  this  last  comment  I  mean 
that  I  have  striven  to  hook  up  the  representation 
of  painting  knowledge  to  more  basic  knowledge 
whenever  possible.  So,  the  representation  "knows"

The  Problem  of  Matching 

We  have  been  t a l k i ng  about  how  Ms.  Malaprop  i n t e(cid:173)
grates  a  story  statement  by  matching 
it  against 
some  frame  statement.  The  l a st  section  was  con(cid:173)

the  events  they  describe  were  over  so  long  before 
the  new  event  that  there  cannot  be  any  r e l a t i o n. 
In  other  cases  the  time  d i s p a r i ty 
is  not  so  great

time  w i ll  only  serve  to  eliminate  c e r t a in  pos(cid:173)
s i b i l i t i es  w i t h in  a  p a r t i c u l ar  frame.  For  example:

some  newspaper.  Question  :  Why  ?  Answer  :

Appendix 

To  give  the  reader  some  idea  of  the  actual  repre(cid:173)
sentation, 
I  have  included  here  two  examples  of 
frames  as  they  are  handed  to  Ms.  Malaprop.  Before 
a c t u a l ly  being  used  however  they  are  converted 
to 
a  somewhat  more  convenient  property 
format, 
and  some  redundant  pointers  are  added.
