Abstract

Holonic Multi-Agent Systems (HMAS) are a con-
venient and relevant way to analyze, model and
simulate complex and open systems. Accurately
simulate in real-time complex systems, where a
great number of entities interact, requires extensive
computational resources and often distribution of
the simulation over various computers. A possi-
ble solution to these issues is multilevel simulation.
This kind of simulation aims at dynamically adapt-
ing the level of entities’ behaviors (microscopic,
macroscopic) while being as faithful as possible to
the simulated model. We propose a holonic organi-
zational multilevel model for real-time simulation
of complex systems by exploiting the hierarchical
and distributed properties of the holarchies. To
fully exploit this model, we estimate the deviation
of simulation accuracy between two adjacent lev-
els through physics-based indicators. These indi-
cators will then allow us to dynamically determine
the most suitable level for each entity in the applica-
tion to maintain the best compromise between sim-
ulation accuracy and available resources. Finally a
3D real-time multilevel simulation of pedestrians is
presented as well as a discussion of experimental
results.

self-similar structures composed of holons as substructures.
They are neither parts nor wholes in an absolute sense. The
organizational structure deﬁned by holons, called holarchy,
allows the modeling at several granularity levels. Each level
corresponds to a group of interacting holons.

Since we consider several individuals and their relation-
ships, the complexity of the system is increased. One issue in
the real-time simulation of complex systems is to allow mul-
tilevel simulation. This type of simulation aims at dynami-
cally adapting the level of the entity behaviors (microscopic,
macroscopic) while being as faithful as possible to the sim-
ulated model. We propose a holonic organizational multi-
level model for real-time simulation of complex systems by
exploiting the hierarchical and distributed properties of the
holarchies. To fully exploit this model, we estimate the de-
viation of simulation accuracy between two adjacent levels
through physics-based indicators. These indicators will then
allow us to dynamically determine the most adapted level for
each entity of the application to maintain the best compromise
between simulation accuracy and available resources.

After a short review of related works, this paper will intro-
duce our holonic organizational model. Then we will detail
our physics-based indicators and how to integrate them into
a multilevel model. Finally a 3D real-time multilevel simu-
lation of pedestrians is presented as well as a discussion of
experimental results.

Introduction

1
A large complex system contains a great number of inter-
acting entities. Their components are themselves complex
(nested relationship) and the boundaries of the system are
difﬁcult to determine. Some behaviors and patterns emerge
as a result of interactions between elements [Simon, 1996;
Holland, 1995; Rodriguez, 2005]. Exhibiting all these char-
acteristics, the urban environments can thus be considered as
complex systems. In recent years, scientiﬁc community has
seen an great number of research works dedicated to com-
plex systems. Multiagent systems are emerging as one of the
most adapted tools for analysis, modeling and simulation of
this kind of systems. The holonic paradigm [Koestler, 1967]
and its application to multiagent systems have proven to be
an effective solution to model complex systems [Tecchia et
al., 2001; Ulieru and Geras, 2002]. Holons are deﬁned as

A great number of works dedicated to multilevel simu-
lation have already been proposed in many scientiﬁc do-
social simulation [Troitzsch, 1996], virtual ur-
mains :
ban simulation [Donikian, 1997],
robotics [Pettinaro et
al., 2003], real-time multilevel simulation platforms [Kim,
2001]. However, multilevel modeling works are mainly con-
centrated on Computer-Aided Design (CAD) optimizations
[Schwabacher, 1998]. Besides the major part of existent mul-
tilevel models work with a ﬁxed number of levels, usually
two : microscopic and macroscopic. Moreover the level at
which an entity is simulated is usually ﬁxed, determined a
priori by the designer according to its experience and exper-
imental results of previous simulations. This point of view
is shared by [Ghosh, 1986] who proposes the ﬁrst dynamical
multilevel simulation. His approach is based on hierachical
models from an abstract level to a more concrete one.

As soon as we consider a highly detailed simulation of
several individuals and their relationships, the complexity of
the system and the associated computational costs increase.
The multilevel simulation appears as one of the best solu-
[Brogan and Hodgins, 2002] and [Musse and Thal-
tions.
mann, 2001] propose multilevel behavioral models for mo-
bile entities in virtual environments or situated environments,
where various behaviors are attached to virtual characters.

In the multiagent domain, works dealing with multilevel
problems mainly focus on the study of emergent phenom-
ena with various approaches : mathematical, biological, or
a purely multiagent way. MAS models for emergence usually
deal with multilevel emergent structures (also called multi-
ple emergence) [Heylighen, 1989] and focus on the detec-
tion and the recognition of behavioral patterns [Beurier et al.,
2003]. Multiagent-based simulations (MABS) often lead to
the emergence of local groups of entities [Servat et al., 1998],
but provide no means of manipulating them. Giving a full
sense to multiagent simulations would certainly imply the dy-
namic creation of agent’s groups, but also their agentiﬁcation
[Van Aeken,
to deal with speciﬁc behaviors at each level.
1999] introduces the notion of minimal multiagent system to
study the dynamics of multiagent systems. This approach is
based on the creation of a composed agent for each couple of
atomic agent that could be merged. Even if its model remain
relatevily abstract and difﬁcult to apply to real applications,
we can consider that with HMAS we adopt an equivalent ap-
proach. But the modularity and the reusability of the holonic
organizational model (cf. section 3.1) allow us to overcome
Van Aeken’s model drawbacks. Our approach consists in dy-
namically grouping agent and creating new level, and also
determining the deviation of simulation accuracy between ad-
jacent levels through physic-inspired indicators. The aims of
these indicators is to dynamically detect when it’s necessary
to switch between simulation levels.

3 An holonic multiagent approach for

multilevel simulation

3.1 An holonic organizational model
A holon can be seen, depending on the level of observation,
either as an autonomous ”atomic” entity or as an organization
of holons. This duality of holons, sometimes called the Janus
Effect in reference to the two faces of a holon, is particu-
larly useful for the multilevel simulation and is detailed in the
next section. In order to allow a modular and reusable model-
ing that minimizes impact on the underlying architecture, we
have leaned for a model based on an organizational approach.
We have selected the framework of [Rodriguez et al., 2006;
Rodriguez, 2005] based on the Role-Interaction-Organization
(RIO) model [Hilaire et al., 2000] to represent organiza-
tions. This model enables formal speciﬁcation, animations
and proofs based on the OZS formalism [Gruer et al., 2004].
OZS is a multi-formalisms language combining Object-Z and
Statechart notations to describe an agent’s role. Statecharts
are used to describe the behavior of the roles, and specify
their possible states and how events may change these states.
Object-Z schemas describe operations called by the state-
chart.

So as to maintain this framework as generic as possible,
[Rodriguez, 2005] distinguishes two aspects that overlap in
a holon. The ﬁrst is directly related to the holonic character
of the entity, i.e. a holon (super-holon) is composed of other
holons (sub-holons or members). This aspect is common to
every holon, thus called holonic aspect. And the second is
related to the problem(s) the members are trying to solve, and
thus speciﬁc to the application or domain of application.

A super-holon is an entity in its own right, but it is com-
posed by its members. Then, we need to consider how mem-
bers organize and manage the super-holon. This constitutes
the ﬁrst aspect of the holonic framework. To describe this
aspect, [Rodriguez, 2005] deﬁne a particular organization
called Holonic Organization. This organization represents a
moderated group [Gerber et al., 1999] in terms of roles and
their interactions. It deﬁnes three main roles corresponding to
the status of a member inside a super-holon. The Head role
players are the representatives or moderators of the group,
and a part of the visible interface. For the represented mem-
bers two different roles have been deﬁned. The Part role
represents members belonging to only one super-holon. The
Multi-Part role is played by sub-holons shared by more than
one super-holon. In this approach, every super-holon must
contain at least one instance of the Holonic Organization. Ev-
ery sub-holon must play at least one role of this organization
to deﬁne its status in the super-holon composition.

Super-holons are created with an objective and to perform
certain tasks. To achieve these goals/tasks, members must
interact and coordinate their actions. The framework also of-
fers means to model this second aspect of the super-holons.
These goal-dependent interactions are modeled using organi-
zations, called Internal Organizations, since they are speciﬁc
to each holon and its goals/tasks. The behaviors and interac-
tions of the members can thus be described independently of
their roles as a component of the super-holon. The set of in-
ternal organizations can be dynamically updated to describe
additional behaviors. The only strictly required organization
is the Holonic organization that describes member’s status in
the super-holon. At the holon level, organizations are instan-
tiated into groups. Figure 5 depicts an example of such an
instanciation. Notation g1: Scheduling denotes that g1 group
is an instance of the organization Scheduling. Super-holon 21
is thus composed of three groups. The ﬁrst one represents an
instance of the holonic organization, and the other two groups
instanciate the goals-dependent organizations : Scheduling
and Pedestrian Navigation1.

This approach guarantees a clear separation between the
management of the super-holon and the goal-speciﬁc behav-
iors and favors modularity and re-usability. Further details on
the framework can be found in [Rodriguez, 2005].

dependent from the applications, our approach focus on the
scheduling aspect to remain generic. So we propose to exploit
the hierarchical structure and scalable properties of the hol-
archy to ensure dynamical scheduling of the behaviors (role)
at various simulation levels. This approach is essentially ded-
icated to simulations requiring good performances (real-time,
virtual reality. . . ) and involving a great number of individuals
and their relationships (i.e. crowd, trafﬁc or more generally
urban simulation). By simulation levels, we refer to the ac-
curacy, the complexity and/or the realism of the individuals
behaviors.

Each individual is associated to an atomic holon. These
holons are grouped into super-holons according to their afﬁn-
ity. Then super-holons are grouped in their turn, and so on,
to obtain a single and complete holarchy. The afﬁnity mea-
sures, according to the applications objectives and simulation
constraints, the compatibily of two holons to work together to
a shared objective (inspired from [Rodriguez, 2005]). In this
context afﬁnity is exploited to dynamically aggregate holons
to obtain a scheduling holarchy coherent with application ob-
jectives. A holon can thus change of super-holons during
the simulation if its goals have evolved and thus impacted its
afﬁnity with other members. Afﬁnity provides an easy mean
to integrate application constraints in our model.

Each holon of this holarchy plays at least one role in the
scheduling organization and one role corresponding to the be-
havior related to the application. If we have two or more in-
dependant application behaviors/roles to schedule at various
levels, we have to dispose of one holarchy per role.

The behaviors related to the scheduling mechanisms are
depicted in the RIO diagram shown in ﬁgure 1. The Schedul-
ing organization deﬁnes ﬁve roles : The Scheduler role have
to be played by a holon having and controlling its own com-
putational resources (i.e.
thread, computer . . . ). This role
provides to its player the right to schedule2 holons playing the
role multilevelScheduler or Scheduled. The Scheduled role
provides the right to schedule/execute its roles. The multi-
levelScheduler role have absolutely to be played by a super-
holon (composed). It represents a fusion of the two previous

2Considering we use an organizational approach, executing a
holon is modeled using an interaction between scheduler and sched-
uled where the ﬁrst provides the computational resource to the sec-
ond.

This role also provides all required tools to dynamically de-
termine if it is necessary to schedule its members or its ap-
plication roles (cf. the section 4 on the next page). Environ-
mental Reactor represents the environment and allowed other
roles to add/remove holon body to the environment. Simula-
tion’s Controller is dedicated to the controls of the simulation
and their graphical user interfaces if any.

An example of a possible structure of the resulting schedul-
ing holarchy is described in the ﬁgure 2. The lowest level
of the holarchy represents the simulation most accurate level
where each individual is modeled using an atomic holon. This
level is commonly described as the microscopic level. Then
the more we rise in the holarchy the more the application
behavior is aggregated. The wide range of possible simula-
tions levels is depicted in ﬁgure 3. The height of the holarchy
depends on the afﬁnity function that deﬁnes how holons are
grouped, this holarchy is build from a dynamic bottom-up ap-
proach. Each new super-holons is associated with a behavior
of a more aggregated level than its members. This mecha-
nisms allows thus to simulate applications behaviors at sev-
eral granularity levels.

4 A physics inspired evaluation of simulation

accuracy

One of the main problems in MAS is the evaluation of the
accuracy/efﬁciency of the system relatively to the task to per-
form and to the local mechanisms involved. Our measure-

IJCAI-07

1277

ments are designed by considering local and/or global char-
acteristics such as individual holon goal, system’s goal, and
holons’ and environmental dynamics. In order to tackle this
issue, solutions have been developed in the literature taking
inspiration from biology (ﬁtness value), sociology (altruism)
or physics (energy). Among the physics inspired measure-
ments, the most widespread is entropy which value represents
disorder/organization in the system. Several ways to compute
entropy were proposed from the hierarchical social entropy
[Balch, 2000] to the dynamic and static entropy [Parunak and
Brueckner, 2001]. However, this kind of analysis has two
main drawbacks. First, since it depends on the past transfor-
mations of the system, entropy cannot be considered as a state
function (i.e. two identical system can be in a same state but
with two different values for their entropy depending on their
previous states). Second, entropy is mainly a global mea-
surement that does not take into account local mechanisms of
the system. In order to evaluate the accuracy of our multi-
level simulation and to overcome these drawbacks, we have
designed three measurements that are inspired by different
energy values wide used in physics :
• Kinetic energy Eci : measurement linked to the dynam-
ics (velocity) of the considered holon i.
• Goal potential energy Epgi : measurement linked to the
individual goal to reach for holon i.
• Constraints potential energy Epci : measurement linked
to interactions of holon i with other holons and with ob-
stacles in environment.

+Epgk

These three measurements can be considered as state func-
tions since they only depend on current parameters (velocity,
position relatively to the individual goal, positions of obsta-
cles/other holons, etc). Moreover, these measurements can
be used whatever the level of the considered holon in the ho-
larchy (microscopic, mesoscopic, macroscopic). The way to
compute the various energies is dependent from the applica-
tion, and will be detailed in the following sections (cf. section
5.2).
According to these three energies, we can deﬁne the global
energy of a holon k by Ek = Eck
+Epck. This energy
is characteristic of the current state of a holon and thus can be
used to determine the deviation of the simulation accuracy
between two adjacent levels. In that way, we introduce the
notion of level similarity s, deﬁned by :
n+1 = En+1

(1)
with En
the en-
i
ergy of its super-holon j (level n + 1). If the similarity is
aiming toward zero, we can consider that the upper level con-
situtes a good estimate of the lower level. If the difference is
increasing, it can be interpreted as a degradation of the upper
level approximation. The similarity can thus be considered as
a indicator of the quality of the approximation realized by a
more aggretated behavioral level.

while maintaining a reasonable frame rate. Multiagent Sys-
tems are a convenient way to simulate such behaviors at the
ﬁnest level but it often requires a lot of computations and it is
thus often difﬁcult to maintain acceptable performances for
the 3D visualization unless having important computational
resources. This is a typical application where the complex-
ity/realism of simulated behaviors have to be adapted accord-
ing to simulation constraints, here available computational re-
sources. We propose to adapt our holonic multilevel model
to this case study and detail the instanciation of the previous
physics-based indicators.
5.1 Pedestrian Model
In this application, we are interested in simulating pedestrian
navigation (virtual human) in urban environment, this kind
of behavior is used in a wide range of applications : Escape
panic, Urban Dynamics, Bus Network Validation. . .

We use an organizational model, so pedestrian behaviors
are deﬁned in terms of roles and interactions. The Pedes-
trian organization, depicted in ﬁgure 4, describes the three
main roles involved in the simulation of pedestrian motion :
Actor and Perceptor provide means to act, resp. perceive,
in the urban environment (role Environment). Integration of
the perceptions and computation of the motion according to
holon objectives and environmental constraints (other holons
and obstacles) are assured by the Pedestrian role.

In this application, we have choosen an hybrid approach :
in the low levels of the holarchy the pedestrian behav-
ior of a super-holon is the same of its members but per-
ceptions/actions are aggregated, and then we use aggregate
pedestrian behaviors.

Afﬁnity between two pedestrians is deﬁned according to
three main functions : the distance between holon objectives,
the distance between holon location, and the energetic afﬁnity
(cf. equation 2).

Given i and j two holons, Aﬀener(i, j) =

The two lowest levels of the resulting scheduling holarchy
are shown in ﬁgure 5. Four pedestrians are grouped into a
super-holons, if available computational resources are com-
fortable. The super-holon schedules its multilevelScheduler
role and thus schedules its members, else it schedules its
pedestrian behavior. All members play the Head role in the
holonic organization of the holon 21, because they have all
an equivalent part in the decision making process within their
super-holon. Super-holon 21 (mesoscopic level 1) disposes
of the same pedestrian behavior as its members but its per-
ceptions correspond to an aggregation of its members per-

5.3 Experimental Results and discussion
We have introduced a holonic multiagent model for multi-
level simulation. First we have compared computational costs
(in millisecond) between microscopic and mesoscopic sim-
ulation levels. Experimental results are presented in ﬁgure
6. These results conﬁrm that mesoscopic approximation is
effectively less expensive than the microscopic level. That
validates rising in the scheduling holarchy implies a reduc-
tion of computational cost. So our model is able to adapt
agent behavioral level according to simulation constraints, i.e
computational cost. Then we can consider that mesoscopic
level maintain a good approximation of pedestrian behavior
because the difference between energy value (level similarity)
is relatevily small and the animation of pedestrian navigating
into the 3D world remains realistic compared to microscopic
level. Finally using this model, we have succeeded to sim-
ulate on a quite performant computer3 a reasonable number

3Pentium 4 2.40GHz, 512 Mo RAM, GeForce3 Ti 200

ceptions. Its environmental body corresponds to a group of
individual bodies. When a motion is computed, all members
bodies are impacted by the same movement. Thus we exploit
the self-similarity of the holon to reuse the same behavior at
various levels, in this case a meso holon can be considered
as a kind of elementary pedestrian boids. Aggregating per-
ceptions and actions allows a signiﬁcant reduction of compu-
tational costs while maintaining a relatively good simulation
accuracy.

Instanciation of physics-based indicators

5.2
This section will introduce a physics-based evaluation of sim-
ulation accuracy for the case study of pedestrian simula-
tion. Each pedestrian disposes at least of one objective (local
and/or global). To model pedestrian behavior, we use a clas-
sical force model based on three main forces : a forward force
(3) attracting the holon to its goal, and two repulsive forces
from other holons (4) and the obstacles (5).

6 Conclusion and Future Works
In this paper, we have presented a holonic multi-agent
scheduling model to enable multilevel simulation. To achieve
that we exploit the hierarchical structure and scalable proper-
ties of the holarchy to assure a dynamical scheduling of the
application’s entities at various behavioral levels. The use
of an organizational approach allows a modular and reusable
model. This approach conﬁrms that multiagent systems allow
through multilevel mechanism to simulate complex systems
while satisfying application dependent constraints, like real-
time. This work is part of a larger effort to develop a whole
holonic multiagent simulation platform. Further works will
particularly deepen the study of levels’ transition (micro ↔
meso). Based on our physics-based indicators, we will try to
determine if and when it is really appropriate to change level,
by trying to foresee at short terms the next states of a holon.
