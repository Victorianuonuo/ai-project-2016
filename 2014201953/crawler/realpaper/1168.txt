Abstract

The Web is experiencing an exponential growth
in the use of weblogs or blogs, websites contain-
ing dated journal-style entries. Blog entries are
generally organised using informally deﬁned labels
known as tags.
Increasingly, tags are being pro-
posed as a ‘grassroots’ alternative to Semantic Web
standards. We demonstrate that tags by themselves
are weak at partitioning blog data. We then show
how tags may contribute useful, discriminating in-
formation. Using content-based clustering, we ob-
serve that frequently occurring tags in each clus-
ter are usually good meta-labels for the cluster con-
cept. We then introduce the Tr score, a score based
on the proportion of high-frequency tags in a clus-
ter, and demonstrate that it is strongly correlated
with cluster strength. We demonstrate how the Tr
score enables the detection and removal of weak
clusters. As such, the Tr score can be used as an
independent means of verifying topic integrity in a
cluster-based recommender system.

1 Introduction

A weblog (blog) is a website containing journal-style entries
presented in reverse chronological order and generally writ-
ten by a single user. Over the past few years, there has been an
exponential growth in the number of blogs [Sifry, 2006] due
to the ease with which blog software enables users to publish
to the web, free of technical or editorial constraints.

However,

the decentralised and independent nature of
blogging has meant that tools for organising and categoris-
ing the blog space are lacking. The solutions to this problem
can be characterised by two positions: the tagging approach
and the Semantic Web approach. Tags are short informal de-
scriptions, often one or two words long, used to describe blog
entries (or any web resource). There is no globally agreed list
of tags the user can choose from, nor is there an agreed best
practice for tagging. Conversely, researchers on the Seman-
tic Web project have proposed frameworks in which blogs
are marked up using machine-readable meta-data, written in
a language such as RDF, which would facilitate cross-blog
indexing [Cayzer, 2004; Karger and Quan, 2005].

Tagging has achieved widespread acceptance by blog users
and advocates argue this is due to its simplicity [Quintarelli,
2005]. Bloggers can easily categorise resources without hav-
ing to learn the precise vocabulary of a formally deﬁned clas-
siﬁcation scheme. The drawback is that a tag is deﬁned lo-
cally and there is no mechanism for indicating that two tags
mean the same thing.

As tagging has been so widely adopted, we present an em-
pirical evaluation of how tags perform in organising and an-
notating blogs. Using a simple clustering approach, we ﬁrstly
demonstrate that tags perform poorly compared to a standard
content-based approach. We then introduce a supporting role
for tags. We observe that a power law probability distribution
exists for the frequency of tag usage within clusters. Using
measures of intra- and intercluster distance, we demonstrate
that ‘strong’ clusters are more likely to contain high propor-
tions of high-frequency tags than weak clusters. We observe
that high-frequency tags are usually good meta-labels for the
cluster concept. We introduce, Tr, a score based on the pro-
portion of high-frequency tags in a cluster, and demonstrate
that it is strongly correlated with cluster strength. Finally, we
demonstrate how the Tr score enables the detection and re-
moval of clusters that appear coherent but are in fact weak
and impure. As the Tr score is produced by the aggregated
tag data from a set of independent users, it can be viewed as
an independent means of verifying cluster topic integrity.

In Section 2, we describe recent work on tagging. In Sec-
tion 3, we describe our datasets: a blog dataset and a labelled
newsgroup dataset that we use for comparison purposes. We
compare clustering using content and tags in Section 4. In
Section 5, we show that tags can be used as cluster meta-
labels. We introduce the Tr score and demonstrate empiri-
cally that it can be used to automatically identify clusters with
poor semantics. We present our conclusions in section 6.

2 Background
The Semantic Web vision for the blog domain is typiﬁed
by prototype applications in which a RDF-based data model
inference-enabled querying of blogs
allows sophisticated,
[Cayzer, 2004; Karger and Quan, 2005].
In contrast, tag-
ging is a ‘grassroots’ solution to the problem of organis-
ing distributed web resources, with emphasis on ease of use.
Tags are ﬂat propositional entities and there are no techniques
for specifying ‘meaning’, inducing a hierarchy or inferring

or describing relationships between tags. Despite the obvi-
ous weakness of this approach, tagging appears to be part
of a trend toward information sharing on the Internet. Sites
like the blog aggregator, Technorati1, the photo sharing site,
Flickr2, and the social bookmarks manager, Del.icio.us3, all
rely upon tags to allow users to discover blogs, photos and
websites tagged by other people. Quintarelli [2005] proposes
that tag usage engenders a folksonomy, an emergent user-
generated classiﬁcation. Although the mechanisms of such a
self-organising process are not clearly outlined, we do share
the view that aggregated tag data can provide discriminating
features for partitioning purposes.

Brooks and Montanez [2005] have analysed the 350 most
popular tags in Technorati in terms of document similarity
and compared these to a selection of similar documents re-
trieved from Google.
In this paper we will show that the
most popular tags form a small percentage of the overall tag
space and that a retrieval system using tags needs to employ
at least token-based matching to retrieve a larger proportion
of tagged blogs. Golder and Huberman [2006] provide a good
introduction to the dynamics of collaborative tagging on the
Del.icio.us social bookmarks site. However, the Del.icio.us
site differs from the blog domain in that tags are applied in
a centralised way to URLs generally belonging to other peo-
ple. A Del.icio.us user can view the bookmark tags already
applied to the URL he wishes to index and choose an existing
tag or use another. This aggregating facility is not available
to the blogger, who must tag a piece of writing he/she has just
completed. Whereas a tag on Del.icio.us references the URL
of a website, a blogger’s tag often references a locally deﬁned
concept.

Although the popular collective term ‘blogosphere’ implies
a type of social network, recent research suggests that less-
connected or unconnected blogs are in the majority on the
Web [Herring et al., 2005]. Link analyses on our datasets
have produced the same results. For this reason we do not
consider links between blogs in this paper.

3 Data
Our blog dataset is based on data collected from 13,518 blogs
during the 6-week period between midnight January 15 and
midnight February 26, 2006. All blogs were written in En-
glish and used tags. Blogging activity obeys a power law,
with 88% of bloggers posting between 1 and 50 times during
the period and 5% posting very frequently (from 100 to 2655
posts). On inspection, many of these proliﬁc bloggers were
either automated blog spammers or community blogs. We se-
lected data from bloggers who had posted from 6 to 48 times
during the evaluation period. The median for this sample is
16 posts. On average, each user posted at least once per week
during the six-week period.

For each user we selected the tag that was used on the
largest proportion of the user’s posts during the evaluation
period. We aggregated these posts to form a single docu-
ment. Thus, each document represents the collective posts

indexed under a single tag by one user during the evaluation
period. We removed stop-words and stemmed each docu-
ment. Low-frequency words appearing in less than 0.2% of
the documents, and high-frequency words occuring in more
than 15% of the documents were then removed. Documents
with less than 15 tokens were discarded at this point. The
features in each instance were weighted using the TF/IDF
weighting scheme. In order to account for documents of dif-
ferent lengths, each instance was normalised so that it was of
unit length (cid:2)dtf idf (cid:2)
2 = 1. This produced a dataset, blog c,
based on blog content with 7209 instances and 3857 tokens
(see Table 1).

We created a second view of the data based on the same set
of documents as blog c but using the tag data of each docu-
ment instead of the content. We tokenised each tag and per-
formed stop-word removal and stemming as before. Further-
more, we removed 24 very commonly occurring tag tokens
such as ‘general’ and ‘random’ (see Section 5.1). We then
removed instances that did not share at least one token with
at least one other instance in the dataset. This produced a
dataset, blog t, based only on tag tokens with 6064 instances
and 1003 tokens (see Table 1). Each document in blog t rep-
resents the tokens from a single tag used by a single user.
The set of users in this dataset is a subset of the users in the
‘content’ dataset.

3.1 Newsgroup Data

The 20 newsgroup dataset is a popular labelled dataset for ex-
periments in text classiﬁcation and clustering4. In the news-
group domain users post dated messages in a public place to
which on-line readers may reply. However, newsgroups are
logically organised into topics and contributors must select
a relevant forum before writing, whereas blogs are blogger-
centred and their authors write without fear of being censured
for non-relevance. For comparison purposes we performed a
parallel set of experiments on this dataset.

We based our dataset on 92% of the 18,826 posts, which
were dated during a 4-week period from April 5 to May 3
1993. We extracted 11,139 email addresses from the head-
ers of the posts, each of which acted as a unique user id. As

with the blog dataset, we created a document for each user
containing the largest number of posts made to a single news-
group during the 4-week period. Stop-words were removed
and the remaining words stemmed. Too frequent and infre-
quent words were removed. At this point documents with
less than 15 words were discarded. Each word was weighted
according to the standard TF/IDF weighting scheme and the
document vector was normalised so that it was of unit length
(cid:2)dtf idf (cid:2)
2 = 1. This produced a dataset, news c, with 7183
instances and 3247 features (see Table 1). Each instance is
associated with 1 out of 20 newsgroup class labels.

Unlike the blog dataset, the newsgroup dataset does not
have a user-deﬁned tag associated with the posts a user makes
in a single newsgroup. Instead, each post has a short subject
header designed to summarise the content of the post. We
created a synthetic tag for the posts of a single user by ag-
gregating the tokens from the subject header of each post,
removing duplicate tokens and stop-words, and stemming.
The remaining tokens were then weighted using TF/IDF and
normalised. This produced a dataset, news t, with 7183 in-
stances and 3152 features (see Table 1).

4 Partitioning by Tags or Content

A simple way to recommend new blog posts would be to use
the tag label of each post to retrieve posts by other bloggers
with the same tag, an approach used by Technorati and anal-
ysed by Brooks and Montanez [2005]. However, a problem
with this approach is illustrated by Figure 1: the frequency
distribution for blog tag overlap follows a power law. From
7209 documents, there were 3934 tags of which only 563
(14%) were used 2 or more times, meaning that 86% of tags
were useless for retrieval using an exact matching approach.
However, by allowing a partial match between tag tokens the
overlap is much greater, allowing us to make at least 1 match
based on shared tag tokens for the 6064 documents in the
blog t corpus.

For our ﬁrst experiment we use a text-clustering approach
where we compare the partitioning produced using tag to-
kens, content tokens and random assignment. For the blog
datasets we use only the 6064 blog instances found both in
blog c and blog t. We implement the spherical k-means al-
gorithm because of its efﬁciency in partitioning large cor-
pora and its ability to produce cluster concept descrip-
tions [Dhillon et al., 2001]. In these experiments we do not
address the issue of an optimal value of k as we are interested
simply in the partitioning ability of tags compared to content.
We cluster the content data and the tag data for both the blog
and newsgroup datasets at values of k from 5 to 100. For each
value of k, a random seed is chosen after which k-1 seeds are

H scores were measured based on the content tokens of the
document instances.

incrementally selected by choosing the seed with the greatest
distance to the mean of the seeds already selected. As a base-
line we create a partition of k clusters by randomly assigning
instances.

Typically, clustering ‘goodness’ on unlabelled datasets is
measured using criterion functions based on intra- and inter-
cluster distance. Following Zhao and Karypis [2004], we use
the ratio of intra- to intercluster similarity, Hr. Intracluster
similarity, Ir, is the average of the cosine distances of each
instance in the cluster to the cluster centroid, Cr. Intercluster
similarity, Er, is the cosine distance of the cluster centroid to
the centroid of the entire dataset, C (see Equation 1). H is
the summation of the Hr contributions of each cluster where
each Hr score is weighted by the fraction of the overall in-
stances contained in the cluster. |Sr| is the size of cluster r.

4.1 Discussion
Using the random clustering as a baseline, we can see from
Figure 2a that clustering by blog tag tokens achieves 22%
of the area under the curve achieved by the content cluster-
ing. Figure 2b shows results from the same experiment on
the newsgroup dataset. Clustering using tag tokens performs
considerably better for the newsgroup dataset, achieving 37%
of the area achieved by clustering using content tokens. Our
results would suggest that any recommendation service based
on blog tag matching is likely to recommend/retrieve posts
that are only marginally more relevant than a selection of
posts chosen at random. We suggest that the better perfor-
mance of the newsgroup tags is due to the fact that the sub-
ject header of a post is generally adopted by other users who
choose to make a reply, whereas the distributed architecture
of the blog domain means that users must select tags in an
arbitrary fashion.

In order to conﬁrm that the Hr is a good indicator of topic
cohesiveness, we conduct a simple experiment on the labelled
newsgroup dataset (news c). At each value of k we measure
the purity of each cluster, Pr i.e. the fraction of the cluster

made up of instances of a single class. At each value of k we
correlate Pr against Hr. Figure 3 illustrates a high positive
correlation for all values of k, suggesting that Hr is indeed
a good indicator of whether a cluster contains documents of
a single class. Figure 3 also illustrates the low correlations
achieved for clusters generated randomly.

5 Cluster Meta Labels and the T
In the previous section we suggested that blogs tags cannot
usefully partition our datasets. In this section, we propose a
supporting role for tags where clustering is carried out us-
ing content. We cluster the content datasets as before but
this time we examine how the tag token data is distributed
per cluster. For example, we cluster blog c and then examine
how the associated tokens in blog t are distributed through-
out the clusters. Figure 1 demonstrates that few tags are used
very frequently and the majority of tags and tag tokens are
used once. Partitioning the data using content clustering, we
observe a tag token frequency distribution per cluster which
seems to vary according to cluster strength (Hr). Weak clus-
ters tend to have a long ﬂat distribution, that is, few or no
high-frequency tags (tokens) and a long tail of tags that have
been used only once. Strong clusters tend to contain many
high-frequency tags and a shorter tail.

Figure 4 illustrates the tag distribution for 2 clusters where

Figure 4: Tag token frequency distribution for cluster 41
(high Hr) and cluster 94 (low Hr).

k =100. Clusters 41 and 94 contain 47 and 43 instances per
cluster respectively. Cluster 41 is in the top 20% of Hr scores
and cluster 94 is in the bottom 20%. We propose that the
probability of distributed users independently using the same
tag is higher in a cluster with a well deﬁned topic (high Hr)
than in a cluster where the topic is weakly deﬁned (low Hr).
In the next section, we deﬁne a score, Tr, based on the pro-
portion of high-frequency tag tokens in a cluster and we test
the correlation of Tr against Hr. We show that clusters with
low Tr scores have poor semantic description in terms of the
most highly weighted terms in the cluster centroid. More im-
portantly, we demonstrate that Tr allows us to identify (and
remove) clusters with spuriously high Hr scores.

5.1 Tag Types

We can qualify the tag frequencies per cluster. C-tags are tag
tokens not repeated by any other user in the cluster. These
tags are represented by the long tail of the frequency dis-
tribution. B-tags are tag tokens with a frequency ≥2 that
occur in ≥2 clusters. B-tags are analogous to stop-words,
words that are so common that they are useless for index-
ing or retrieval purposes. Furthermore, b-tags also tend to
be words with non-speciﬁc meaning, such as ‘assorted’, ‘ev-
erything’and ‘general’. As such, they do not contribute to
cluster interpretation. Our experiments on the blog dataset
identiﬁed a set of 24 b-tags which remained consistent even
when we clustered the data on a weekly basis. A-tags are the
remaining high-frequency tags. As Table 4 demonstrates, the
average percentage of b-tag tokens in a cluster varies little for
different values of k. On the other hand, as k increases there
is a trade-off between a-tags and c-tags. As clusters become
smaller, fewer co-occurring tags are found, decreasing the a-
tag count and increasing the c-tag count. At k =50 on the blog
dataset, only 24% of tags in a cluster, on average, are a-tags.
Clearly, a-tags should contribute to cluster interperatability as
they represent an independent description of the cluster topic
by 2 or more users.

Figure 5: The mean correlation between Hr and Tr for the 6
blog and 4 newsgroup datasets.

Table 4: The table gives the mean fractions of a-tags, b-tags
and c-tags per cluster at different values of k. The means are
measured over the 6 windowed blog datasets.

Table 3 lists the top 8 clusters of the blog c dataset ranked
in terms of Hr where k = 50. Clusters are described in terms
of the top 5 most highly weighted terms in the cluster centroid
and in terms of their most frequent a-tags. In many cases the
a-tag descriptors for each cluster provide clear meta-labels for
each cluster. For example, cluster 16, which contains many
documents on a recent upgrade to the Wordpress blog soft-
ware, is described as ‘blog, technology, tech’. In some cases,
such as cluster 42, a-tags provide contextual information not
included in the keyword descriptions. The term ‘olympics’ in
the a-tag list is due to the fact that 8 of the documents in this
cluster refer to knitting while watching the Winter Olympics.
Two rows in Table 3, representing clusters 46 and 11, are
marked in bold. Although the Hr scores of these clusters lie
within the top 20%, the centroid keywords for these clusters
do not impart a clear description of a topic. This is problem-
atic as we would expect a high Hr score to imply a coher-
ent topic description. In the next section we describe the Tr
score, which is based on the proportion of a-tags in each clus-
ter. We show how these problematic clusters can be created
due to noise in the feature set and how the Tr score allows us
to identify them.

5.2 The Tr score
The Tr score is the fraction of a-tags in a cluster, scaled by
the cluster size. Ar, Br and Cr are the (disjoint) sets of a-, b-
and c-tags respectively found in cluster r. n is the number of
instances in cluster r.

In order to test that the correlation between Tr and Hr is
consistent over time, we created 6 datasets, each dataset rep-
resenting a week’s worth of data from the blogs represented
in the blog c dataset. Likewise, we divided the newsgroup
dataset into 4 weekly datasets. We measured the correlation
between Tr and Hr for each dataset at values of k from 5 to
100. We found that the correlation was high for all datasets
and all values of k, suggesting a strong relationship between
cluster strength and tag frequency. Figure 5 illustrates the
mean correlation between Tr and Hr for the 6 blog datasets
and the 4 newsgroup datasets at different values of k.

However, examining the top 8 (out of 50) Hr scores shown
in Table 3 we can see that the Tr and Hr scores appear to
disagree strongly in several places. In fact, clusters 46 and 11
have Tr scores that lie within the bottom 20% of Tr scores
for this clustering. This is not an anomaly: it can also be ob-
served in each clustering of the 6 weekly blog datasets. Clus-
ters 46 and 11 are also clusters whose top-weighted centroid
key words provide us with no clear concept description. As
text clustering is based on token-based matching of sparsely
featured instances, without consideration for semantics, it is
possible for clusters with high Hr scores but with poor se-
mantics to emerge. This poses problems for an application
such as a blog recommender system, where a misleadingly
high Hr score would cause blogs to be recommended that
have nothing in common.

One source of error is noise in the feature set. For exam-
ple, on inspecting the instances in cluster 11 we found that the
high Hr score was due to the matching of noisy token features
such as ‘http’ and ‘www’, which were extracted from lists of
URLs posted as free text. We suggest that the Tr score, be-
cause it measures human consistency in assigning descriptors
to documents in a cluster, facilitates the identiﬁcation of clus-
ters that may in fact be meaningless.
5.3 Using Tr to Remove Noisy Clusters
As the blog dataset is unlabelled, our assessment of whether
a cluster is meaningful or not is overly subjective.
In this
section we describe a more rigorous experiment using the la-
belled news c and news t datasets, where we measure the ef-
fect on cluster purity after we remove clusters that have a high
Hr and low Tr.

We limit the number of tokens per instance in news t to
the top TF/IDF weighted tag token. Thus, the average token
frequency is comparable to the mean of 1.27 for the blog t
dataset (see Table 1). Secondly, because news t has a much
greater proportion of a-tags per cluster than the blog data, we
raise the value of k to 250, which decreases the mean propor-
tion of a-tags per cluster to 0.34, which is comparable with
the mean observed in the blog dataset when k is between 20
and 50 (See Table 4).

We select the top 20% of clusters ranked according to Hr
ˆH. We then select the
in descending order, which we term
bottom 20% of clusters ranked according to Tr in descending
ˇT pro-
order, which we term
vides us with a set of candidate ‘weak’ clusters, W. To de-

300 and 350 using randomly selected seeds for each cluster-
ing. Table 5 shows 5 results from the experiment conducted
at k = 250. Table 6 shows the mean purities recorded for k
=250, 300 and 350.

5.4 Discussion
From Table 6 we can see that the mean purity values for W,
the set of ‘weak’ clusters identiﬁed using Tr, are considerably
ˆH, the top 20% of clusters. At
lower than the mean values for
ˆH.
k=250, the mean purity of W is 0.6 of the mean purity of
ˆH we see an overall increase
By removing these clusters from
ˆH-W). This in-
in mean purity (as shown by the purity for
crease in purity is generally small because, on average, the
number of clusters in W is small. However, we note that the
increase was observed in all 150 tests. We tested the differ-
ence using a 1-tailed t-test and found that it was signiﬁcant
at the 0.05 alpha level. The key result of this experiment is
that the Tr allowed us to automatically identify a subset of
clusters with poor purity scores, which the standard Hr score
could not identify. The straw man in this experiment was the
ˆH-W recorded higher
random selection technique. In all tests
ˆH-R and this difference was found to be
purity scores than
signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level.

6 Conclusions

Increasingly, tagging is being proposed as a decentralised al-
ternative to Semantic Web standards.
In the blog domain,

however, we ﬁnd that tags are rather poor at partitioning blog
data. Using content-based clustering, we observe that a small
proportion of users in every cluster have independently used
the same tag tokens to describe his/her posts. The key ob-
servation is that the Tr score, a score based on tag frequency
in a cluster, is an independent measure of agreement on the
cohesiveness of a cluster topic and can be used to automat-
ically identify weak clusters not identiﬁable using standard
distance-based measures. Our future work in this area in-
volves tracking and measuring topic drift in the blog domain.
In particular we are devising tag-based scores which indicate
the growth and decay of blog topics.
