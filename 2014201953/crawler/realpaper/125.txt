Abstract

This paper, motivated by functional brain imaging
applications, is interested in the discovery of sta-
ble spatio-temporal patterns. This problem is for-
malized as a multi-objective multi-modal optimiza-
tion problem: on one hand, the target patterns must
show a good stability in a wide spatio-temporal re-
gion (antagonistic objectives); on the other hand,
experts are interested in (cid:2)nding all such patterns
(global and local optima). The proposed algorithm,
termed 4D-Miner, is empirically validated on arti-
(cid:2)cial and real-world datasets; it shows good per-
formances and scalability, detecting target spatio-
temporal patterns within minutes from 400+ Mo
datasets.

1 Introduction
Spatio-temporal data mining is concerned with (cid:2)nding spe-
ci(cid:2)c patterns in databases describing temporally situated spa-
tial objects. Many approaches have been developed in sig-
nal processing and computer science to address such a goal,
ranging from Fourier Transforms to Independent Component
Analysis [Hyvarinen et al., 2001], mixtures of models [Chu-
dova et al., 2003] or string kernel machines [Saunders et al.,
2004], to name a few. These approaches aim at particular pat-
tern properties (e.g. independence, generativity) and/or focus
on particular data characteristics (e.g. periodicity). How-
ever, in some application domains, the above properties are
not relevant to extract the patterns of interest. The approach
presented in this paper is motivated by such an application
domain, functional brain imaging. Non invasive techniques,
speci(cid:2)cally magnetoencephalography(MEG) [H¤am¤al¤ainen et
al., 1993], provide measures of the human brain activity with
an unprecedented temporal resolution (time step 1 millisec-
ond). This resolution enables researchers to investigate the
timing of basic neural processes at the level of cell assem-
blies [Pantazis et al., 2005]. A key task is to (cid:2)nd out which
brain areas are active and when, i.e. to detect spatio-temporal
regions with highly correlated activities.
It is emphasized
that such regions, referred to as stable spatio-temporal pat-
terns (STPs), are neither periodic nor necessarily indepen-
dent. Currently, STPs are manually detected, which (be-
sides being a tedious task) severely hampers the reproducibil-

ity of the results. This paper addresses the automatic detec-
tion of stable spatio-temporal patterns, i.e. maximal spatio-
temporal regions with maximal correlation. This detection
problem cannot be formalized as a multi-objective optimiza-
tion (MOO) problem [Deb, 2001], because experts are in-
terested in several active brain areas: an STP might be rel-
evant though it corresponds to a smaller spatio-temporal re-
gion, with a lesser correlated activity than another STP. The
proposed approach thus extends MOO along the lines of
multi-modal optimization [Li et al., 2002], de(cid:2)ning a multi-
objective multi-modal optimization framework (MoMOO).
MoMOO is tackled by an evolutionary algorithm termed 4D-
Miner, using a diversity criterion to relax the multi-objective
search (as opposed to diversity enforcing heuristics in MOO,
e.g. [Corne et al., 2000; Laumanns et al., 2002]; more on
this in section 2.3). To the best of our best knowledge,
both the extension of evolutionary algorithms to MoMOO,
and the use of multi-objective optimization within spatio-
temporal data mining are new, although MOO attracts in-
creasing attention in the domain of machine learning and
knowledge discovery (see, e.g., [Ghosh and Nath, 2004;
Francisci et al., 2003]). Experimental validation on arti(cid:2)-
cial and real-world datasets demonstrates the good scalabil-
ity and performances of 4D-Miner; sought STPs are found
within minutes from medium sized datasets (450 Mo), on PC-
Pentium 2.4 GHz. The paper is organized as follows. Section
2 formalizes the detection of stable spatio-temporal patterns
as a multi-modal multi-objective optimization problem, and
motivates the use of evolutionary algorithms [B¤ack, 1995;
Goldberg, 2002] for their detection. Section 3 gives an
overview of 4D-Miner. Section 4 describes the experiment
goals and setting. Section 5 reports on the extensive valida-
tion of 4D-Miner on arti(cid:2)cial and real-world data. Section 6
discusses the approach with respect to relevant work, and the
paper ends with perspectives for further research.

be a time interval, and let (cid:22)C I
i denote the average activity of
the i-th measure point during I. The I-alignment (cid:27)I (i; j) of
measure points i and j over I is de(cid:2)ned as:

As the sought patterns do not need to be spheric, ellipsoidal
distances are considered. Only axis-parallel ellipsoids will be
considered throughout the paper. For each weight vector w =
(a; b; c) (w 2 IR+3), distance dw is de(cid:2)ned on the measure
points as:
dw(i; j) =qa(xi (cid:0) xj )2 + b(yi (cid:0) yj)2 + c(zi (cid:0) zj)2
2.2 Multi-objective formalization
A pattern X = fi; I; w; rg is characterized by a center point
i, i 2 [1; N ], a time interval I, an ellipsoidal distance dw, and
a radius r > 0. The spatial neighborhoodB(i; w; r) is de(cid:2)ned
as the set of measure points j such that dw(i; j) is less than r.
The spatial amplitude of X, noted a(X), is the number of
measure points in B(i; w; r). The temporal amplitude of X,
noted ‘(X), is the number of time steps in interval I. The
spatio-temporal alignment of X, noted (cid:27)(X) is de(cid:2)ned as
the average, over all measure points in B(i; w; r), of their I-
alignment with respect to the center i :

(cid:27)(X) =

1

a(X) Xj2B(i;w;r)

(cid:27)I (i; j)

Interesting spatio-temporal patterns, according to the ex-
pert’s (cid:2)rst speci(cid:2)cations, show maximal spatial and temporal
amplitudes together with a maximal spatio-temporal align-
ment. Speci(cid:2)cally, a solution pattern is such that i) increas-
ing its spatial or temporal amplitude would cause the spatio-
temporal alignment to decrease; ii) the only way of increasing
its spatio-temporal alignment is by decreasing its spatial or
temporal amplitude. It thus comes naturally to formalize the
STP detection in terms of multi-objective optimization prob-
lem (see [Deb, 2001] and references therein; [de la Iglesia et
al., 2003; Bhattacharyya, 2000] for related data mining ap-
proaches).

The three a; ‘ and (cid:27) criteria induce a partial order on the

and

set of patterns, referred to as Pareto domination.
De(cid:2)nition 1. (Pareto domination)
Let c1; :::cK be K real-valued criteria de(cid:2)ned on domain (cid:10),
and let X and Y belong to (cid:10).
X Pareto-dominates Y , noted X (cid:31) Y , iff ck(X) is greater or
equal ck(Y ) for all k = 1::K, and the inequality is strict for
at least one k0.
(X (cid:31) Y ) () (cid:26) 8k = 1::K; (ck(X) (cid:21) ck(Y ))

9k0 s:t: (ck0 (X) > ck0 (Y ))

The set of non-dominated solutions after a set of criteria is
classically referred to as Pareto front [Deb, 2001].
2.3 Multi-modal multi-objective formalization
However, the above criteria only partially account for the
expert’s expectations: a STP might have a lesser spatio-
temporal alignment and amplitude than another one, and still
be worthy, provided that it corresponds to another active brain
area. Therefore, not all sought STPs belong to the Pareto
front.

Multi-modal optimization, interested in (cid:2)nding global and
local optima of the (cid:2)tness landscape, has been extensively
studied in the EC literature [Li et al., 2002]. Based on the
multi-modal framework, a new framework extending multi-
objective optimization and referred to as multi-modal multi-
objective optimization (MoMOO), is thus proposed. For-
mally, let us (cid:2)rst de(cid:2)ne a relaxed inclusion relationship, noted
p-inclusion.
De(cid:2)nition 2. (p-inclusion)
Let A and B be two subsets of set (cid:10), and let p be a posi-
tive real number (p 2 [0; 1]). A is p-included in B, noted
A (cid:26)p B, iff jAT Bj > p (cid:2) jAj.
De(cid:2)ning adequately the support of a candidate solution X
(see below) multi-modal Pareto domination can be de(cid:2)ned as
follows:
De(cid:2)nition 3. (multi-modal Pareto domination)
With same notations as in Def. 1, X mo-Pareto dominates Y ,
noted X (cid:31)mo Y , iff the support of Y is p-included in that of
X, and X Pareto-dominates Y .
X (cid:31)mo Y () [(Supp(Y ) (cid:26)p Supp(X)) and (X (cid:31) Y )]
the support of X = (i; I; w; r)
In the case of STPs,
is naturally de(cid:2)ned as Supp(X) = B(i; dw; r) (cid:2) I, with
Supp(X) (cid:26) [1; N ] (cid:2) [1; T ].
In contrast with [Corne et al., 2000; Laumanns et al., 2002]
who use diversity-based heuristics for a better sampling of the
Pareto front, diversity is thus used in MoMOO to rede(cid:2)ne and
extend the set of solutions.
2.4 Discussion
Functional brain imaging sets two speci(cid:2)c requirements on
spatio-temporal data mining. First, the expert’s requirements
are subject to change. Much background knowledge is in-
volved in the manual extraction of stable spatio-temporal pat-
terns, e.g. about the expected localization of the active brain
areas. A (cid:3)exible approach, accommodating further criteria

and allowing the user to customize the search (in particular,
tuning the thresholds on the minimal spatial or temporal am-
plitudes, or spatio-temporal alignment) is thus highly desir-
able.

Second, the approach must be scalable with respect to the
data size (number of measure points and temporal resolution).
Although the real data size is currently limited, the computa-
tional cost must be controllable in order to ef(cid:2)ciently adjust
the user-supplied parameters; in other words, the mining al-
gorithm must be an any-time algorithm [Zilberstein, 1996].

The approach proposed is therefore based on evolution-
ary algorithms (EAs); these are widely known as stochas-
tic, population-based optimization algorithms [B¤ack, 1995;
Goldberg, 2002] that are highly (cid:3)exible. In particular, EAs
address multi-modal optimization [Li et al., 2002] and they
can be harnessed to sample the whole Pareto front associated
to a set of optimization criteria, with a moderate overhead
cost compared to the standard approach (i.e., optimizing a
weighted sum of the criteria gives a single point of the Pareto
front) [Deb, 2001]. Last, the computational resources needed
by EAs can be controlled in a straightforward way through
limiting the number of generations and/or the population size.

3 Overview of 4D-Miner
This section describes the 4D-Miner algorithm designed for
the detection of stable spatio-temporal patterns.
3.1
Following [Daida, 1999], special care is devoted to the ini-
tialization of this evolutionary algorithm. The extremities of
the Pareto front, where STPs display a high correlation (re-
spectively, a low correlation) on a small spatio-temporal re-
gion (resp. a wide region), do not ful(cid:2)ll the expert’s expecta-
tions. Accordingly, some user-supplied thresholds are set on
the minimal spatio-temporal amplitude and alignment.

are based on Euclidean distance);

In order to focus the search on relevant STPs, the initial
population is generated using the initialization operator, sam-
pling patterns X = (i; w; I; r) as follows:
(cid:15) Center i is uniformly drawn in [1; N ];
(cid:15) Weight vector w is set to (1; 1; 1) (initial neighborhoods
(cid:15) Interval I = [t1; t2] is such that t1 is drawn with uniform
distribution in [1; T ]; the length t2(cid:0)t1 of Ij is drawn ac-
cording to a Gaussian distribution N (min‘; min‘=10),
where min‘ is a time length threshold2.
(cid:15) Radius r is deterministically computed from a user-
supplied threshold min(cid:27), corresponding to the minimal
I-alignment desired.

r = minkfdw(i; k) s:t: (cid:27)I

i;k > min(cid:27))g

All patterns X whose spatial amplitude a(X) is less than a
user-supplied threshold mina are non-admissible; they will
not be selected to generate new offspring. The user-supplied
thresholds thus govern the proportion of usable individuals in
the initial population.

2In case t2 is greater than T , another interval I is sampled.

The computational complexity is in O(P (cid:2) N (cid:2) min‘),
where P is the population size, N is the number of measure
points and min‘ is the average length of the intervals.

3.2 Variation operators
From parent X = (i; w; I; r), mutation generates an off-
spring by one among the following operators:

An offspring is said admissible iff it satis(cid:2)es the user-supplied
thresholds mentioned in the initialization step.

3.3 Selection scheme
A Pareto archive is constructed with size L (set to 10 (cid:2)P in
the experiments).
A steady-state scheme is used; at each step, an admissible
parent X is selected among K uniformly drawn individuals
in the population, by retaining the one which is dominated by
the fewest individuals in the archive (Pareto tournament [Deb,
2001]). A single offspring Y is generated from X by applying
a variation operator among the ones mentioned above.

a(Y ); ‘(Y ); (cid:27)(Y ). Y is rejected if it is mo-Pareto dominated
in the population; otherwise, it replaces a non-admissible
individual in the population if any; if none it replaces an in-
dividual selected after anti-Pareto tournament (the individual
out of K randomly selected ones in the population, that is
dominated by the most individuals in the archive).

The archive is updated every P generations, replacing the
mo-Pareto dominated individuals in the archive with individ-
uals selected from the population after Pareto tournament.

4 Experimental setting and goal
This section presents the goal of the experiments, describes
the arti(cid:2)cial and real-world datasets used, and (cid:2)nally gives
the parameters of the algorithm and the performance mea-
sures used to evaluate the algorithm.

4.1 Goals of experiments and datasets
The initial goal is to provide the expert with a usable STP de-
tection algorithm. The real datasets have been collected from
people observing a moving ball. Each dataset involves 151
measure points and the number of time steps is 875. As can be
noted from Fig. 1, which shows a representative dataset, the
amplitude of the activities widely vary along the time dimen-
sion. The other goal is to assess the scalability and the perfor-
mances of 4D-Miner, which is done using arti(cid:2)cial datasets.
The arti(cid:2)cial datasets are generated as follows. N mea-
sure points are located in uniformly selected locations in the
3D domain [0; 1]3. Activities are initialized from random cu-
mulative uniform noise, with Ci(t + 1) = Ci(t) + (cid:15), and
(cid:15) is drawn according to U (0; (cid:28) ). Every target STP S =
(i; w; I; r; (cid:14)) is de(cid:2)ned from a center i, a weight vector w,
a time interval I, a radius r, and a fading factor (cid:14), used to
bias the activities as detailed below. The activity CS of the
STP S is the average activity in the spatio-temporal region
B(i; w; r) (cid:2) I. Thereafter, activities are biased according to
the target STPs: for each measure point j, for each STP S
such that j is in(cid:3)uenced by S (dw(i; j) < r), the activity
Cj(t) is smoothed as

Cj(t) = (1 (cid:0) e(cid:0)(cid:11)i(j;t))Cj(t) + e(cid:0)(cid:11)i(j;t)CS

where (cid:11)i(j; t) = dw(i; j) + (cid:14) (cid:2) d(t; I)

and d(t; I) is the distance of t to interval I (0 if t belongs
to I, otherwise the minimum distance of t to the bounds of
I). The scalability of 4D-Miner is assessed from its empirical

ulation size P = 200, evolved along 8000 generations (8,000

used to adjust the operator rates; the mutation and crossover
rates are respectively set to .7 and .3.

spatial support of Y , and there is an overlap between their
time intervals.

The maximal size of the datasets (T = 8000; N = 4000)
is 456 Mo. Computational runtimes are given on PC-Pentium
IV, 2.4 GHz. 4D-Miner is written in C++.

and the number T of time steps.

The performances of 4D-Miner are measured using the
standard criteria in information retrieval, recall and precision.
The recall is the fraction of target STPs that are identi(cid:2)ed by
4D-Miner, i.e. p-included in an individual in the archive; the
precision is the fraction of relevant individuals in the archive
(p-included in a target STP). For each experimental setting
(see below), the recall and precision are averaged over 21 in-
dependent runs. The number of target STPs is set to 10 in
all experiments. Each STP in(cid:3)uences a number of measure
points varying in [10,20], during intervals uniformly selected
in [1; T ] with length varying in [15, 25], and (cid:14) uniformly se-
lected in [0; :05]. Each problem instance thus includes STPs
with various levels of dif(cid:2)culty; the detection is hindered as
the spatio-temporal support (r and I) is comparatively low
and the (cid:14) parameter increases (the regularity is not visible
outside interval I, as in Fig 2).

Typical STPs found in the real datasets are shown in Figs. 3
and 4, showing all curves belonging to the STP plus the time-
window of the pattern. The runtime is less than 1 minute (PC
Pentium 1.4 GHz). As discussed in section 2.3, many relevant
STPs are Pareto-dominated: typically the STP shown in Fig
3 is dominated by the one in Fig 4.

These patterns are considered satisfactory by the expert.
All experiments con(cid:2)rm the importance of the user-de(cid:2)ned
thresholds, controlling the quality of the initial population.
Due to the variability of the data, these threshold parameters
are adjusted for each new experiment.

The coarse tuning of the parameters can be achieved based
on the desired proportion of admissible individuals in the ini-
tial population. However, the (cid:2)ne-tuning of the parameters
could not be automatized up to now, and it still requires run-
ning 4D-Miner a few times. For this reason, the control of
the computational cost through the population size and num-
ber of generations is one of the key features of the algorithm.

proach: a graceful degradation of the recall is observed as T
and N increase. It must be noted that STPs occupy a negli-
gible fraction of the spatio-temporal domain (circa 10(cid:0)4 for
T = 8000, N = 4000). The average precision is low, rang-
ing from 12 to 20% (results omitted due to space limitations).
However, post-pruning can be used to sort the wheat from
the chaff in the (cid:2)nal archive, and increase the precision up to

50% without decreasing the recall; the post-pruning straight-
forwardly removes the STPs with small spatial or temporal
amplitudes.
Quite different effects are obtained when the archive is pruned
along the search (e.g. by increasing the thresholds on the min-
imal spatial and temporal amplitudes), which decreases the
overall performances by an order of magnitude; interestingly,
similar effects are observed in constrained evolutionary op-
timization when the fraction of admissible solutions is very
low.

A (cid:2)nal remark is that the performances heavily depend
upon the user-supplied thresholds (section 3.1), controlling
the diversity and effective size of the population. Indeed, a
parametric model of the dataset would enable automatic ad-
justment of these parameters. It might also be viewed as a ad-
vantage of 4D-Miner that it does not require any prior model
of the data, and that inexpensive preliminary runs can be used
to adjust the needed parameters.

6 Relevant work
This brief review does not claim exhaustiveness; the inter-
ested reader is referred to [Shekhar et al., 2003; Roddick
and Spiliopoulou, 2002] for comprehensive surveys. Spatio-
temporal data mining applications (e.g., remote sensing, envi-
ronmental studies, medical imaging) are known to be compu-
tationally heavy; as most standard statistical methods do not
scale up properly, new techniques have been developed, in-
cluding randomized variants of statistical algorithms. Many
developments are targeted at ef(cid:2)cient access primitives and/or
complex data structures (see, e.g., [Wu et al., 2004]); an-
other line of research is based on visual and interactive data
mining (see, e.g., [Keim et al., 2004]), exploiting the unri-
valed capacities of human eyes for spotting regularities in 2D-
data. Spatio-temporal data-mining mostly focuses on clus-
tering, outlier detection, denoising, and trend analysis. For
instance, [Chudova et al., 2003] used EM algorithms for
non-parametric characterization of functional data (e.g. cy-
clone trajectories), with special care regarding the invariance
of the models with respect to temporal translations. The
main limitation of such non-parametric models, including
Markov Random Fields, is their computational complexity,
sidestepped by using randomized search for model estimates.

7 Discussion and Perspectives
This paper has proposed a stochastic approach for mining sta-
ble spatio-temporal patterns. Indeed, a very simple alterna-
tive would be to discretize the spatio-temporal domain and
compute the correlation of the signals in each cell of the dis-
cretization grid. However, it is believed that the proposed
approach presents several advantages compared to the brute
force, discretization-based, alternative. First of all, 4D-Miner
is a fast and frugal algorithm; its good performances and scal-
ability have been successfully demonstrated on medium sized
arti(cid:2)cial datasets. Second, data mining applications speci(cid:2)-
cally involve two key steps, exempli(cid:2)ed in this paper: i) un-
derstanding the expert’s goals and requirements; ii) tuning
the parameters involved in the speci(cid:2)cations. With regard to
both steps, the ability of working under bounded resources is
a very signi(cid:2)cant advantage; any-time algorithms allow the
user to check whether the process can deliver useful results,
at a low cost. Further research is concerned with extend-
ing 4D-Miner in a supervised learning perspective ((cid:2)nding
the STPs that are complete (cid:0) active in several persons un-
dergoing the same experiment (cid:0) and correct (cid:0) not active in
the control experiment). The challenge is to directly handle
the additional constraints of completeness and correction in
the multi-objective multi-modal optimization framework pre-
sented here.
