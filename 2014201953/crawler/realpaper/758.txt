Abstract

Qualitative reasoning about mereotopological rela-
tions has been extensively investigated, while more
recently geometrical and spatio-temporal reasoning
are gaining increasing attention. We propose to
consider mathematical morphology operators as the
inspiration for a new language and inference mech-
anism to reason about space. Interestingly, the pro-
posed morpho-logic captures not only traditional
mereotopological relations, but also notions of rel-
ative size and morphology. The proposed represen-
tational framework is a hybrid arrow logic theory
for which we deﬁne a resolution calculus which is,
to the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst such calculus
for arrow logics.

Introduction

1
Intelligent agents sensing or exchanging information about
the physical world need ways to represent and reason about
space. For instance, humans navigating new areas may build
‘cognitive maps’ of the environment [Redish, 1999], robots
engaged in a soccer game may use Monte-Carlo-Localization
based on probabilistic representations from the raw sensory
data [Thrun et al., 2001], and crawlers analyze web pages
using relative position and size, such as in the Lixto system
[Gottlob and Koch, 2004], to index the pages. In fact, the way
space is represented and reasoned upon varies tremendously
depending on the nature of the agents and on their tasks.

A paramount criterion for representing space is that of hav-
ing an agile language able to capture basic qualitative as-
pects of space and providing simple reasoning mechanisms
for making diagrammatic deductions. In this line is the study
of part-whole and topological relationships for describing
qualitative aspects of region connections. This study, known
as mereotopology, has been widely investigated by philoso-
phers, logicians and, recently, computer scientists. The best
known proposal in the AI literature is the region connection
calculus (RCC) [Randell et al., 1992]: a calculus of regions
based on 8 basic qualitative mereotopological relations. With
RCC one may express that a region is contained into another
one, that it overlaps with another one or that it is discon-
nected. Reasoning is left to composition tables for deter-

mining the spatial relations among regions given the binary
relations.

In general, one wants more from spatial reasoning. A way
of achieving more is that of considering the logic of some
theory of space and then perform deduction using the logic’s
inference mechanisms. [Bennett, 1995] showed that a decid-
able fragment of RCC can be embedded into a multimodal
logic. In general, one is interested in logical theories of space:
Tarski’s axiomatization of elementary geometry is the most
successful example and is the motivation for the recent effort
of considering logical theories of space (see [Aiello et al.,
2007] for a wide set of spatial and spatio-temporal logics).

Our goal in the present treatment is to consider a logical
approach to qualitative spatial reasoning that, without giv-
ing up on the mereotopological expressiveness, is also able
to capture prominent morphological and geometrical proper-
ties of space. To fulﬁll this goal we turn our attention to a
nifty mathematical theory.

Mathematical morphology (MM), developed in the 60s by
Matheron and Serra for creating methods for the estimation of
ore deposits [Matheron, 1967; Serra, 1982], underlies mod-
ern image processing, where it has a wide variety of applica-
tions. Compared with classical signal processing approaches
it is more efﬁcient in image preprocessing, enhancing object
structure, and segmenting objects from the background. The
idea behind MM is that one can ﬁnd objects with different
properties by probing an image with so called ‘structuring el-
ements’. Although Serra and Materhorn developed their the-
ory for binary images, morphological operators exist for both
grey scale and color images as well.

The connections between mathematical morphology and
logic were recently highlighted by Bloch et al. for both spa-
tial reasoning [Bloch, 2000] and agent coordination [Bloch
and Lang, 2002]; while in [Aiello and van Benthem, 2002],
we spelled out the connections with arrow and linear logics.
We dig into the connections hinted in these works. We
show how mathematical morphology sheds a new light on
spatial reasoning by considering a novel encoding into hybrid
arrow logic and by providing a complete reasoning method
for the introduced logic. Our proposal is not ‘yet another
modal RCC encoding’ as the language we introduce is more
expressive than RCC. For instance, we show that our morpho-
logic is able to express the concept of relative size which is
not expressible in RCC and which introduces a new notion

of granularity. Similarly to Aiello and van Benthem and dif-
ferently from Bloch, in our representation worlds are points
in space, rather than abstract worlds, allowing to reason on
actual images. In [Aiello and van Benthem, 2002] we pre-
sented only the initial connections among MM and modal
logic with no further study, here we take it to the next step
and turn Mathematical Morpho-logic into a powerful spatial
reasoning tool. Finally, we remark that the proposed logic in-
creases the expressive power in the direction of morphology
and vector spaces, and not towards incidence or projective
geometries as in, e.g., [Balbiani et al., 1997].

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion 2, after recalling basic MM deﬁnitions, we introduce the
morpho-logic and show how to take advantage of its expres-
sive power. In Section 3 we introduce a resolution calculus
for the morpho-logic which we implemented in Haskell. Fi-
nal considerations are presented in Section 4.

2 Mathematical Morpho-languages
Honoring the mathematical in the name, Mathematical Mor-
phology has an algebraic base [Heijmans and Ronse, 1990].
Its two basic operators, the dilation and the erosion, work on
a complete lattice. For example, the P(IR2) together with
the subset relation constitutes a complete lattice. Dilation is
an operator that distributes over the supremum, while ero-
sion distributes over the inﬁmum. Given a group of automor-
phisms (translations) in a complete lattice (L,≤) and a sup-
generating subset l ⊆ L one can create a group structure on l,
G := (l, +,−, e). Using this group, the translation invariant
dilation and erosion can be written in the following manner

A ⊕ B =
A (cid:6) B =

(cid:2){a + b|a ∈ A, b ∈ B}
(cid:2){z ∈ l|Az ≤ B}

An example of a dilation is shown in Figure 1 where a bi-
nary image containing a region denoting India is dilated by a
small disk region. Applying the dilation and erosion succes-
sively, one can create the so called opening and closing. An
opening is an erosion followed by a dilation with the same
structuring element and is used to remove connections be-
tween regions. A closing is a dilation followed by an erosion
with the same structuring element and is used to ﬁll holes of a
certain size in a region. If one then considers the group G for
binary images, one is actually dealing with the vector space
IR2. In this way, one sees how mathematical morphology is
also a language for vector spaces.
2.1 Morpho-logic
Arrow logic is a form of modal logic where the objects, rather
than being possible worlds, are transitions structured by var-
ious relations [Venema, 1996], in particular there is a binary
modality for composition of arrows and a unary modality for
the inverse of an arrow. An arrow usually has the following
structure w = (a, b) with a the beginning of the arrow and
b the end. Such a language naturally models a vector space
which, in turn, is the most intuitive underlying model of math-
ematical morphology. The connections between arrow log-
ics and mathematical morphology were ﬁrst highlighted in

F := p|e|¬ϕ|ϕ ∨ ψ| ˆ⊗ϕ|ϕ ˆ⊕ψ,

[Aiello and van Benthem, 2002]. Let us ﬁrst recall the basic
arrow logic with its truth deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.1 (arrow logic) Let PROP be a set of proposi-
tion letters, then the well-formed formulas F of the arrow
logic are:
where p ∈ PROP, e is a distinguished identity element, and
ϕ, ψ ∈ F
A model consists of a set of arrows, a ternary, a binary and
unary relations, and a valuation function.
Deﬁnition 2.2 (arrow logic semantics) An arrow model M
is a tuple (W, C, R, I, ν) in which W is a set of arrows, C ⊆
W × W × W , R ⊆ W × W and I ⊆ W . Furthermore, ν is
a valuation function such that ν : PROP (cid:9)→ P(W ). The tuple
(W, C, R, I) is called frame. The truth of formulas is deﬁned
in a model at a given arrow w in the following way (omitting
the usual base case and boolean connectives).

M, w (cid:2) e
iff
M, w (cid:2) ˆ⊗ϕ
iff
M, w (cid:2) ϕ ˆ⊕ψ iff

(w) ∈ I
there exists a v ∈ W such that
(w, v) ∈ R and M, v (cid:2) ϕ
there exists v, v(cid:2) ∈ W such that
(w, v, v(cid:2)) ∈ C, M, v (cid:2) ϕ and
M, v(cid:2) (cid:2) ψ

Thus, a formula of the form ˆ⊗ϕ is true in a model M on
a world w if and only if there exists a world v that one can
‘reach’ from w using the relation R such that v satisﬁes ϕ.
In the same manner, a formula of the form ϕ ⊕ ψ is true in a
model M on a world w if and only if there exist two worlds
v and v(cid:2) such that w, v and v(cid:2) are connected via the relation
C, v satisﬁes ϕ and v(cid:2) satisﬁes ψ. For a concrete example
of arrow models, showing the link between vector spaces and
mathematical morphology, consider the meaning of addition
for the ˆ⊕ operator, of vector negation for the ˆ⊗ and of identity
vector to e, i.e.,

• (x, y, z) ∈ C if x = y + z
• (x, y) ∈ R if x = −y
• (x) ∈ I if x = e
In this way the deﬁnition of the interpretation of ϕ ˆ⊕ψ goes

from
{w|∃v, v(cid:2) ∈ W s.t. (w, v, v(cid:2)) ∈ C, M, v (cid:2) ϕ,M, v(cid:2) (cid:2) ψ}
to being

{w|∃v, v(cid:2) ∈ W s.t. w = v + v(cid:2), v ∈ ν(ϕ)v(cid:2) ∈ ν(ψ)}

=

{v + v(cid:2)|v ∈ ν(ϕ) , v(cid:2) ∈ ν(ψ)}

where we have lifted the valuation function to the formulas.
Considering the set deﬁned by the dilation deﬁnition (Equa-
tion 1), one appreciates the similarities with the interpreta-
tion of ϕ ˆ⊕ψ using vectors.
In axiomatizing the language
such that the relations behave as described above, the axiom
x + (−x) = e poses a problem because it is not valid for
arbitrary subsets of the universe. Only if the subsets are sin-
gletons, the axiom is true. To avoid this problem and ﬁnally

arrive to usual vector spaces, we introduce a set of nominals
which provide the expressive power to differentiate among
worlds, that is, among arrows. We thus have the power to
force a singleton set. We are entering the realm of hybrid
logics.

Where in modal logic there is no explicit reference to the
world at the language level, in hybrid logic instead one can
refer to speciﬁc worlds in a model. The nominals are labels
for the elements of W . If syntactically, the nominals have the
same function as propositions; semantically, nominals have
the restriction that the valuation function maps a nominal to
a singleton set. Furthermore, the language contains the satis-
faction operator @iϕ, with the intuitive meaning of bringing
the valuation of the formula ϕ to the world labeled i, i.e., a
world that satisﬁes i.
In addition, in a group the operation + must be deﬁned for
every pair of elements, i.e., ∀x, y∃z s.t. z = x + y. Thus
we need a way to quantify over the set of worlds. This can
be done by introducing the universal modality E. Where in
normal modal logic a formula is inherently local, modal logic
extended with the universal modality has the power to talk
about the entire model. For example, a formula of the form
Eϕ is true in a model if ϕ is true somewhere in the model.
Note that the validity of a formula does not neccissarily de-
pend on where in the model a formula is evaluated. The dual,
U means that a formula must be true everywhere in the model.
We are now in the position to deﬁne the Morpho-logic. The
morpho-logic is a theory in the hybrid arrow logic whose ax-
ioms are shown in Table 1. We present it as an extension of
the arrow logic of Deﬁnition 2.1 in the following way.
Deﬁnition 2.3 (morpho-logic) Let ATOM = PROP∪ NOM be
a set of proposition letters and names, then the well-formed
formulas F of the morpho-logic are:

F := a|e|¬ϕ|ϕ ∨ ψ| ˆ⊗ϕ|ϕ ˆ⊕ψ|@iϕ|Eϕ

where a ∈ ATOM, i ∈ NOM and ϕ, ψ ∈ F .
Deﬁnition 2.4 (morpho-model) A model M is a morpho-
model if M is a model according to deﬁnition 2.2, with ν
extended to the nominals in such a way that ν(i) is a single-
ton set for every i ∈ NOM.
The semantics deﬁned in Deﬁnition 2.2 is straightforwardly
extended by introducing truth deﬁnitions for the at @ operator
and for the nominals as follows:

M, w (cid:2) a
M, w (cid:2) @iϕ iff
M, w (cid:2) Eϕ

iff w ∈ ν(a) with a ∈ ATOM
there exists a v ∈ W such that
M, v (cid:2) i and M, v (cid:2) ϕ
there exists a v ∈ W such that
M, v (cid:2) ϕ

iff

We note that the @ operator becomes superﬂuous because one
can deﬁne it using E, however, for readability we shall use the
@ operator.
Remark 2.5 (Notation) We overload the terms dilation and
erosion from mathematical morphology to the morpho-logic
and deﬁne them as ϕ ˆ⊕ψ and ϕ (cid:6) ψ = ¬(¬ϕ ˆ⊕ ˆ⊗ψ), respec-
tively.

Table 1: The morphological axioms.

Having deﬁned the morpho-logic and its axioms, the next
natural question to ask is what are the laws which the opera-
tors of the morpho-logic obey. The answer comes from look-
ing at their mathematical morphological counterparts. We do
not report here the full axiomatization of the hybrid arrow
language as it can be found in [de Freitas et al., 2002], but
rather report the new axioms with morphological signiﬁcance
(Table 1).
Remark 2.6 (Notation) As a point of notation, we use
KHAL for the axiomatization of the hybrid arrow-logic.

Of all the axioms presented in Table 1, the axiom (rev31)
and (rev32) are the most notable ones. The purpose of the
axioms is to give the relations C, R and I a group semantics.
One of the group axioms is x + (−x) = e. The algebraic
counterpart of ˆ⊕ is (cid:15)+(cid:16), the + operator lifted to the com-
plex group of G. (cid:15)+(cid:16) operates on sets, and a(cid:15)+(cid:16) − a = e
only holds if a is a singleton. In axiom (rev31) and (rev32),
the nominals represent the singleton sets. This is best seen
by looking at the atoms as sets of worlds. Since the set be-
longing to a nominal must be a singleton set we have met the
precondition of the group axiom.

We are now ready to state the completeness result and
sketch its proof. Here, by completeness we mean that given
a set of frames F a set of axioms Λ is complete with respect
to F if for each formula ϕ it is the case that F |= ϕ implies
Λ (cid:17) ϕ.
Theorem 2.7 (completeness) The axioms presented in Ta-
ble 1, together with KHAL and the extended set of derivation
rules, are complete with respect to the set of frames deﬁned
by the axioms in Table 1.
Proof. First, we note that the axioms in Table 1 are pure
formulas. Then, we remark that every pure formula is di-
persistent. Generalizing Theorem 5.3.16 in [Cate, 2005] to
the hybrid arrow logic, we have that the axioms are complete
for the family of frames they deﬁne.

2.2 Expressive power and QSR
The morpho-logic combines the power of talking about re-
lational structures from a local perspective, typical of modal
languages, with expressing global properties using the nomi-
nals to ‘jump’ globally from one point to another in the mod-
els, typical of hybrid ones.

(Figure 1.d).1 Finally, considering the region denoted by
(India ˆ⊕C)∧China (Figure 1.e), we see that it is not empty,
thus the image (the model) veriﬁes the EC∗ relation and we
safely conclude that indeed India and China are indeed neigh-
boring countries.

Interestingly, one can use the geometric expressive power
in the morpho-logic to go beyond mere topological relations
and thus being more expressive than RCC. In fact, taking ad-
vantage of the dilation operation, one is able to deﬁne a no-
tion of relative size. We say that x is smaller than y, and write
St(x, y) if

St(x, y) = Ei ∧ (T P P ∗(x ˆ⊕i, y) ∨ N T P P ∗(x ˆ⊕i, y))

where and T P P ∗ and N T T P ∗ are the RCC tangential proper
part and non-tangential proper part, respectively. This deﬁni-
tion of smaller than takes advantage of the fact that a dilation
with a singleton set is equivalent to a translation.
In plain
words, the region x is smaller than region y, if there exists a
translation such that x is a proper part of y.

3 Reasoning via Resolution
The morpho-logic is an expressive formalism to represent
spatial properties of points and regions of space capturing
topological and morphological content. The next natural
question to ask is how one can use it to reason about space.
We introduce a resolution calculus for the morpho-logic that
is also, to the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst resolution pro-
cedure for an arrow language.
3.1 Resolution for reasoning in the morpho-logic
Resolution is a refutation theorem-proving technique [Bach-
mair and Ganzinger, 2001]. If in model checking one works
with a speciﬁc model and veriﬁes whether a formula is true,
in theorem proving one is concerned with verifying whether
there is a model for a formula. In a refutation theorem prover
the goal is to show that there is no model for its negation. Be-
fore introducing the resolution calculus for the morpho-logic
in the next section, we consider how theorem proving sheds

Figure 1: Finding the EC∗ relation between China and India.

Let us now consider the expressive power in terms of qual-
itative spatial reasoning (QSR). The morpho-logic is able to
express topological and morphological properties of points
and regions. First, we turn our attention to the best-known
example of topological calculus, the region connection calcu-
lus [Randell et al., 1992]. The RCC language uses the prim-
itive C(x, y) holding among two regions x, y if x and y are
connected and then derives a number of relations indicating
the overlapping, the being part or being disconnected of re-
gions. In the morpho-logic, the concept of connectedness is
encoded using dilations: two regions A and B are connected
if A ˆ⊕C overlaps with B. C denotes the notion of connectiv-
ity that is being used. In discrete binary images for example
this could be 4- or 8-connectivity. One can deﬁne RCC-like
relations (denoted with a terminating ∗) using the morpho-
logic as shown in Table 2 where E is the existential modality
deﬁned as dual of the universal one: Eϕ := ¬U¬ϕ.

Let us now consider an example in the domain of binary
images using the RCC relations as deﬁned via the morpho-
logic. For instance, we want to check whether India and
China are neighboring countries (i.e., in the EC∗ relation) in
the map shown in Figure 1.a. Suppose that China and In-
dia are denoted by the propositions ‘China’ and ‘India’ (Fig-
ure 1.b and Figure 1.c, respectively). Then, we can consider
the dilation of the India region by a relatively small disc C

light on mathematical morphology logical view on reasoning
about space and beneﬁts mathematical morphology in return.
In traditional spatial reasoning calculi (such as RCC or
Allen’s one dimensional interval calculus [Cohn and Haz-
arika, 2001]) a paramount task is that of deﬁning composi-
tion tables for the calculi relations. A composition table is
a compact representation for assessing which relation holds
among two locations based on knowledge of other relations.
For example, suppose that there is a relation R1 between lo-
cation a and b, and a relation R2 between b and c. The entry
in the composition table tells us which relations are possible
between a and c. Composition tables are created resorting
to human reasoning, an ad-hoc program performing exhaus-
tive search, or a theorem prover. A successful example of the
latter is Bennett’s use of resolution for reasoning with RCC
relations encoded in intuitionistic logic [Bennett, 1994]. By
having resolution for the morpho-logic it is also possible to
create composition tables for morphological relations. Not
only, it is also possible to check dynamically the validity of
formulas and the composition of any two given relations ex-
pressible in the morpho-language.

Conversely, a resolution based theorem prover is also a
powerful tool in the hands of the mathematical morphology
expert. In mathematical morphology one of the typical tasks
is that of identifying ﬁlters, verify their formulation, and then
test experimentally their effectiveness on collections of im-
ages. For example, the salt-and-pepper ﬁlter, used to ﬁlter
out noise from an image, is known to be idempotent. The task
of design and veriﬁcation of the ﬁlter is based on the exper-
tise of the mathematical morphology scientist. With a resolu-
tion based theorem prover the veriﬁcation of ﬁlter properties
can be automated. Furthermore, if one couples the theorem
prover with a formula generator, one has a way of identifying
new and potentially useful ﬁlters.

3.2 The resolution calculus
The resolution calculus for the morpho-logic builds on the
fact that nominals are available, making it possible to perform
resolution recursively inside the modal operators. Resolution
rules can be applied to clauses. A clause is a set of formu-
lae and it is true if one of the formula in the clause is true.
We extend the resolution calculus for the basic hybrid logic
presented in [Areces et al., 2001] by means of the additional
rules shown in Tables 3, 5, 6. This calculus uses the assump-
tion that all the formulas present in the clauses are given in
negated normal form, i.e. only atoms can occur in the scope
of a negation. The ﬁrst set of rules (Table 3) deals with the
binary ⊕ and unary ˆ⊗ modalities, where the symbol ˆ⊕ is the
dual of ˆ⊕ and is deﬁned as ϕ ˆ⊕ψ = ¬(¬ϕ ˆ⊕¬ψ). Equiva-
ˆˆ⊗ = ¬ ˆˆ⊗ ¬. The
lently,
second set of rules (Table 4) takes care of the universal modal-
ities E and U. Finally, the third set of rules (Tables 5, 6) deals
with the axioms of the morpho-logic (Deﬁnition 1).

In the case of morpho resolution, we have that a clause is
a set of formulas of the form @iϕ. As usual, the semantics
of a clause is the disjunction of its elements. The resolution
calculus then works on the clauses by applying the morpho
resolution rules. Given a set of formulas S = ϕ1, ..., ϕn, this

is satisﬁable if and only if the set of clauses @iϕ1, ...@iϕn
is satisﬁable. Formally, we have the following deﬁnition of
morpho resolution.
Deﬁnition 3.1 (morpho resolution) Given ϕ, a refutation
by morpho resolution of ϕ is a sequence of morpho clauses
C1, . . . , Cn such that for all i ∈ {1..n} either
1. Ci is in ϕ, or
2. Ci is a resolvent of Cj, Ck according to a morpho rule
where Cn is the empty clause and a morpho rule is one of the
rules in Tables 3, 5, 6, or in [Areces et al., 2001].
If there exists no such refutation, ϕ is satisﬁable. We say that
ϕ is valid if there is a refutation of ¬ϕ (i.e., ¬ϕ is unsatisﬁ-
able). We write (cid:17) ϕ for a valid ϕ.

Finally, we want to be sure that reasoning with the resolu-
tion calculus is correct and complete. The following theorem
does the job. For the full proof we refer the reader to [Ottens,
2006] and provide only a proof sketch here.
Theorem 3.2 (completeness) Given a set of clauses Σ of the
morpho-logic, Σ is unsatisﬁable if and only if there exists a
refutation of Σ using the morpho resolution of Deﬁnition 3.1.

Proof. The proof of refutational completeness works by
showing that if there is no refutation, a model of Σ exists
on which all the axioms are valid.

4 Concluding Remarks
Driven by the Mathematical Morphology view of space, we
introduced a language based on hybrid arrow logic to reason
about space. The logic, which is a theory in the hybrid arrow
logic deﬁned by the axioms of Table 1, is a powerful lan-
guage to express morphological as well as mereotopological
properties of space. To reason in the morpho-language we
introduced a resolution calculus. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this is the ﬁrst resolution calculus for arrow logics.
We proved completeness of our language and calculus, while
leaving open for future research issues of complexity [Renz
and Nebel, 1999].

We implemented the morpho resolution in Haskell (http:
//www.haskell.org) as an extension of the HyLoRes
theorem prover [Areces and Heguiabehere, 2001]. We used
the theorem prover for the correctness of a number of the-
orems (including theorems based on the ‘smaller than’ def-
inition of Section 2). We leave for future research the en-
hancement and evaluation of the implementation. The theo-
rem prover is of particular usefulness when showing that the
morpho-logic is not only interesting in AI for performing spa-
tial reasoning, but is also a tool for the computer vision expert
that needs to check, or perhaps even generate, new morpho-
logical ﬁlters.
