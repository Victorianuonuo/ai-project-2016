Abstract

We investigate the properties of an abstract nego-
tiation framework where agents autonomously ne-
gotiate over allocations of discrete resources.
In
this framework, reaching an optimal allocation po-
tentially requires very complex multilateral deals.
Therefore, we are interested in identifying classes
of utility functions such that any negotiation con-
ducted by means of deals involving only a single re-
source at at time is bound to converge to an optimal
allocation whenever all agents model their prefer-
ences using these functions. We show that the class
of modular utility functions is not only sufﬁcient
but also maximal in this sense.

Introduction

1
The problem of discrete resource allocation has recently re-
ceived much attention from the artiﬁcial intelligence commu-
nity. A large amount of this work is focused on combinatorial
auctions [Cramton et al., 2005]. In this case, the allocation
procedure is centralised, and the so-called winner determi-
nation problem consists in determining the allocation of re-
sources maximising the auctioneer’s revenue.

A different perspective is taken when one assumes that the
allocation process is truly distributed, in the sense that agents
autonomously negotiate over the bundles of resources they
hold. This assumption is justiﬁed in many applications where
no central authority can be relied on to decide upon the al-
location of resources. In this case, the system designer will
typically seek to set up the system in such way that it guar-
antees desirable properties, without directly interfering in the
negotiation process itself.
In this paper we will make use
of such an abstract negotiation framework investigated by a
number of authors [Sandholm, 1998; Endriss et al., 2003;
Dunne et al., 2005].

To make things more precise, we assume a set of negotiat-
ing agents populating the system, and we model their prefer-
ences (over different bundles of resources) by means of utility
functions. In order to pursue their own interests, agents agree
on deals beneﬁtting themselves but without planning ahead
(i.e. they are both rational and myopic), thereby modifying
the allocation of resources. From a global point of view, the
quality of an allocation reﬂects the overall performance of the

system, and the designer will naturally seek to ensure that ne-
gotiation converges towards an optimal allocation.

Section 2 introduces the negotiation framework used in this
paper. As we shall recall in Section 3, it is known that very
complex multilateral deals are potentially required to reach an
optimal allocation. When deals are restricted (e.g. to a lim-
ited number of resources), it is only possible to guarantee an
optimal outcome by also restricting the negotiation process
to agents whose preferences have certain properties. In this
paper, we study the conditions under which negotiation con-
ducted by means of the simplest deals, involving one item at
a time (or 1-deal negotiation for short) still allows us to reach
an optimal allocation. Section 4 generalises a result from the
literature and shows that modelling preferences with modu-
lar utility functions is a sufﬁcient condition. However, mod-
ularity is not a necessary condition. This is demonstrated in
Section 5 by means of a counterexample. We also show that
there can be no condition on utility functions that would be
both necessary and sufﬁcient for optimal allocations to be ne-
gotiable by means of rational 1-deals. The main contribution
of this paper is to show that the class of modular utility func-
tions is maximal, in the sense that no class strictly including
the modular utility functions would still be sufﬁcient for 1-
deal negotiation. The proof detailed in Section 6 shows that,
given any non-modular utility function, it is always possible
to construct a modular utility function and select a scenario
where the optimal allocation cannot be reached by 1-deals.
Section 7 concludes.

2 Myopic negotiation over resources
In this section, we introduce the decentralised negotiation
framework used throughout this paper and report a number
of known technical results. In this framework, a ﬁnite set of
agents negotiate over a ﬁnite set of discrete (i.e. non-divisible)
resources. A resource allocation is a partitioning of the re-
sources amongst the agents (that is, every resource has to be
allocated to one and only one agent). As an example, the
allocation A deﬁned by A(i) = {r1} and A(j) = {r2, r3}
would allocate resource r1 to agent i, while resources r2 and
r3 would be owned by agent j.

We are going to model the preferences of agents by means
of utility functions mapping bundles of resources to real num-
bers. Assuming that agents are only concerned with resources
they personally own, we will use the abbreviation ui(A) for

ui(A(i)), representing the utility value assigned by agent i to
the bundle it holds for allocation A. The parameters of a ne-
gotiation problem are summarised in the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 1 (Negotiation problems) A negotiation problem
is a tuple P = hR,A,U, A0i, where

• R is a ﬁnite set of indivisible resources;
• A = {1, . . . , n} is a ﬁnite set of agents (n ≥ 2);
• U = hu1, . . . , uni is a vector of utility functions, such
• A0 : A → 2R is an (initial) allocation.

that for all i ∈ A, ui is a mapping from 2R to R;

Agents may agree on a deal to exchange some of the re-
sources they possess. It transforms the current allocation of
resources A into a new allocation A0; that is, we can deﬁne a
deal as a pair δ = (A, A0) of allocations (with A 6= A0).

We should stress that this is a multilateral negotiation
framework. A single deal may involve the displacement
of any number of resources between any number of agents.
An actual implementation of this abstract framework may,
however, not allow for the same level of generality. Sand-
holm [1998] has proposed a typology of different types of
deals, such as swap deals involving an exchange of single
resources between two agents or cluster deals involving the
transfer of a set of items from one agent to another. The sim-
plest type of deals are those involving only a single resource
(and thereby only two agents).
Deﬁnition 2 (1-deals) A 1-deal is a deal δ = (A, A0) result-
ing in the reallocation of exactly one resource.

constraintP

The above is a condition on the structure of a deal. Other
conditions relate to the acceptability of a deal to a given
agent. We assume that agents are rational in the sense of
aiming to maximise their individual welfare. Furthermore,
agents are assumed to be myopic. This means that agents
will not accept deals that would reduce their level of welfare,
not even temporarily, because they are either not sufﬁciently
able to plan ahead or not willing to take the associated risk
(see also [Sandholm, 1998] for a justiﬁcation of such an agent
model in the context of multiagent resource allocation). We
will, however, permit agents to enhance deals with monetary
side payments, in order to compensate other agents for a pos-
sible loss in utility. This can be modelled using a payment
function p : A → R. Such a function has to satisfy the side
i∈A p(i) = 0, i.e. the overall amount of money
in the system remains constant. If p(i) > 0, then agent i pays
the amount of p(i), while p(i) < 0 means that it receives
the amount of −p(i). The following rationality criterion will
deﬁne the acceptability of deals:
Deﬁnition 3 (Individual rationality) A deal δ = (A, A0)
is rational iff there exists a payment function p such that
ui(A0)−ui(A) > p(i) for all i ∈ A, except possibly p(i) = 0
for agents i with A(i) = A0(i).
From a system designer’s perspective, we are interested in
assessing the well-being of the whole society, or social wel-
fare [Arrow et al., 2002], which is often deﬁned as the sum
of utilities of all the agents.

Deﬁnition 4 (Social welfare) The social welfare sw(A) of
an allocation A is deﬁned as follows:

sw(A) = X

ui(A)

i∈A

This is the utilitarian deﬁnition of social welfare. While this
is the deﬁnition usually adopted in the multiagent systems lit-
erature [Wooldridge, 2002], we should stress that also several
of the other notions of social welfare developed in the social
sciences (e.g. egalitarian social welfare [Arrow et al., 2002])
do have potential applications in the context of multiagent re-
source allocation.

We conclude this background section by recalling two im-
portant results [Sandholm, 1998; Endriss et al., 2003]: the
ﬁrst one makes explicit the connection between the local de-
cisions of agents and the global behaviour of the system, and
the second one is the fundamental convergence theorem for
this negotiation framework.
Lemma 1 (Individual rationality and social welfare) A
deal δ = (A, A0) is rational iff sw(A) < sw(A0).
Theorem 1 (Maximising social welfare) Any sequence of
rational deals will eventually result in an allocation of re-
sources with maximal social welfare.
The main signiﬁcance of this latter result, beyond the equiv-
alence of rational deals and social welfare-increasing deals
stated in Lemma 1, is that any sequence of deals satisfying
the rationality criterion will eventually converge to an optimal
allocation. There is no need for agents to consider anything
but their individual interests. Every single deal is bound to
increase social welfare and there are no local minima.

3 Negotiating over one item at a time
While Theorem 1 shows that, in principle, it is always possi-
ble to negotiate an allocation of resources that is optimal from
a social point of view, deals involving any number of agents
and resources may be required to do so [Sandholm, 1998;
Endriss et al., 2003].
In particular, the most basic type of
deal, which involves moving a single resource from one agent
to another and which is the type of deal implemented in most
systems realising a kind of Contract Net protocol [Smith,
1980],
is certainly not sufﬁcient for negotiation between
agents that are not only rational but also myopic.
This has ﬁrst been shown by Sandholm [1998] and is best
explained by means of an example.1 Let A = {1, 2, 3} and
R = {r1, r2, r3}. Suppose the utility functions of these
agents are deﬁned as follows (over singleton sets):

u1({r1}) = 5
u2({r1}) = 0
u3({r1}) = 1

u1({r2}) = 1
u2({r2}) = 5
u3({r2}) = 0

u1({r3}) = 0
u2({r3}) = 1
u3({r3}) = 5

Furthermore, for any bundle R not listed above, suppose
ui(R) = 0 for all i ∈ A. Let A0 with A0(1) = {r2},
A0(2) = {r3} and A0(3) = {r1} be the initial allocation,
1A methodology for constructing such examples is easily gener-
ated from the proof of the result on the insufﬁciency of any kind of
structurally limited class of deals given by Endriss et al. [2003].

i.e. sw(A0) = 3. The optimal allocation would be A∗ with
A∗(1) = {r1}, A∗(2) = {r2} and A∗(3) = {r3}, which
yields a social welfare of 15. All other allocations have lower
social welfare than A∗. Hence, starting from A0, the deal
δ = (A0, A∗) would be the only deal increasing social wel-
fare. By Lemma 1, δ would also be the only rational deal.
This deal, however, involves all three resources and affects
all three agents. In particular, δ is not a 1-deal. Hence, if we
choose to restrict ourselves to rational deals, then 1-deals are
not sufﬁcient to negotiate allocations of resources with maxi-
mal social welfare.

Of course, for some particular negotiation problems, ra-
tional 1-deals will be sufﬁcient. The difﬁculty lies in recog-
nising the problems where this is so. Closely related to this
issue, Dunne et al. [2005] have shown that, given two alloca-
tions A and A0 with sw(A) < sw(A0), the problem of check-
ing whether it is possible to reach A0 from A by means of
a sequence of rational 1-deals is NP-hard in the number of
resources in the system.

The structural complexity of deals required to be able to
guarantee socially optimal outcomes partly stems from the
generality of the framework.
In particular, so far we have
made no assumptions on the structure of utility functions used
by the agents to model their preferences. By introducing re-
strictions on the class of admissible utility functions, it may
be possible to ensure convergence to an allocation with max-
imal social welfare by means of simpler deals.
In this pa-
per, we are interested in characterising more precisely those
classes of utility functions that permit 1-deal negotiation.
Deﬁnition 5 (1-deal negotiation) A class C of utility func-
tions is said to permit 1-deal negotiation iff any sequence of
rational 1-deals will eventually result in an allocation of re-
sources with maximal social welfare whenever all utility func-
tions {u1, . . . , un} are drawn from C.
Under this perspective, a relevant result is due to Endriss et
al. [2003], who show that rational 1-deals are sufﬁcient to
guarantee outcomes with maximal social welfare in case all
agents use additive utility functions.2 We are going to prove
a slight generalisation of this result in the next section.

4 Modular functions are sufﬁcient
We are now going to deﬁne the class of modular utility func-
tions. This is an important (see e.g. [Rosenschein and Zlotkin,
1994]), albeit simple, class of functions that can be used in ne-
gotiation domains where there are no synergies (neither com-
plementaries nor substitutables) between different resources.
Deﬁnition 6 (Modular utility) A utility function u is modu-
lar iff the following holds for all bundles R1, R2 ⊆ R:
u(R1 ∪ R2) = u(R1) + u(R2) − u(R1 ∩ R2)

(1)

The class of modular functions includes the aforementioned
additive functions. This may be seen as follows. Let R be
any non-empty bundle of resources and let r ∈ R. Then
equation (1) implies u(R) = u(R\{r}) + [u({r})− u({})].

2A utility function is additive iff the utility assigned to a set of

resources is always the sum of utilities assigned to its members.

If we apply this step recursively for every resource in R, then
we end up with the following equation:

u(R) = u({}) +X

[u({r}) − u({})]

(2)

r∈R

That is, in case u({}) = 0, the utility assigned to a set will
be the sum of utilities assigned to its members (i.e. u will
be additive). Clearly, equation (2) also implies equation (1),
i.e. the two characterisations of the class of modular utility
functions are equivalent.

It turns out that in domains where all utility functions are
modular, it is always possible to reach a socially optimal al-
location by means of a sequence of rational deals involving
only a single resource each. This is a slight generalisation of
a result proved by Endriss et al. [2003], and our proof closely
follows theirs.
Theorem 2 (Negotiation in modular domains) The
M of modular utility functions permits 1-deal negotiation.
Proof. By Lemma 1, any rational deal results in a strict in-
crease in social welfare. Together with the fact that the num-
ber of distinct allocations is ﬁnite, this ensures that there can
be no inﬁnite sequence of rational deals (termination).
It
therefore sufﬁces to show that for any allocation that does
not have maximal social welfare there still exists a rational
1-deal that would be applicable.

class

We are going to use the alternative characterisation of mod-
ular utility functions given by equation (2). For any alloca-
tion A, let fA be the function mapping each resource r to the
agent i that holds r in situation A. Then, for modular do-
mains, the formula for social welfare (see Deﬁnition 4) can
be rewritten as follows:

sw(A) = X

ui({}) +X

fA(r)({r})
u0

i∈A

r∈R

i(R) = ui(R) − ui({}). Now assume we have
with u0
reached an allocation of resources A that does not have max-
of social welfare and observing thatP
imal social welfare, i.e. there exists another allocation A0
with sw(A) < sw(A0). Considering the above deﬁnition
i∈A ui({}) is a con-
stant that is independent of the current allocation, this im-
plies that at least one resource r must satisfy the inequation
fA(r)({r}) < u0
fA0 (r)({r}), i.e. the agent owning r in al-
u0
location A values that resource less than the agent owning it
in allocation A0. But then the 1-deal consisting of passing
r from agent fA(r) to agent fA0(r) would already increase
social welfare and thereby be rational.
2

Like Theorem 1, the above establishes an important conver-
gence result towards a global optimum by means of decen-
tralised negotiation between self-interested agents. In addi-
tion, provided all utility functions are modular, convergence
can be guaranteed by means of a much simpler negotiation
protocol, which only needs to cater for agreements on 1-deals
(rather than multilateral deals over sets of resources).

5 Modular functions are not necessary
In the previous section we have introduced a class of utility
functions (namely modular functions) such that it is possible

to guarantee that sequences of rational 1-deals will converge
to an allocation with maximal social welfare under the con-
dition that all agents’ utilities belong to this class. A natural
question to ask would then be whether modularity is also a
necessary condition in this sense.
It turns out that this is not the case. We demonstrate this by
means of the following example. Suppose R = {r1, r2} and
there are two agents with utility functions u1 and u2:

u1({})
= 90
u1({r1})
= 93
u1({r2})
= 95
u1({r1, r2}) = 98

u2({})
= 90
u2({r1})
= 90
u2({r2})
= 90
u2({r1, r2}) = 50

While u1 is a modular function, u2 is not. The optimal allo-
cation is the allocation where agent 1 owns both items. Fur-
thermore, as may easily be checked, any 1-deal that involves
moving a single resource from agent 2 to agent 1 is rational.
Hence, rational 1-deals are sufﬁcient to move to the optimal
allocation for this scenario, despite u2 not being modular.

In fact, it is possible to show that there can be no class of
utility functions that would be both sufﬁcient and necessary
in this sense. It sufﬁces to produce two concrete utility func-
tions u1 and u2 such that (i) both of them would guarantee
convergence if all agents were using them, and (ii) there is a
scenario where some agents are using u1 and others u2 and
convergence is not guaranteed. This is so, because assuming
that a necessary and sufﬁcient class exists, (i) would imply
that both u1 and u2 belong to that class, while (ii) would
entail the contrary. We give two such functions for the case
of two agents and two resources (the argument is easily aug-
mented to the general case):
u1({})
= 0
u1({r1})
= 1
u1({r2})
= 2
u1({r1, r2}) = 3

u2({})
= 0
u2({r1})
= 5
u2({r2})
= 5
u2({r1, r2}) = 5

The function u1 is modular, i.e. all agents using that func-
tion is a sufﬁcient condition for guaranteed convergence to an
optimal allocation by means of rational 1-deals (Theorem 1).
Clearly, convergence is also guaranteed if all agents are using
u2. However, if the ﬁrst agent uses u1 and the second u2,
then the allocation A with A(1) = {r1} and A(2) = {r2} is
not socially optimal and the only deal increasing social wel-
fare (and thereby, the only rational deal) would be to swap
the two resources simultaneously. Hence, no condition on all
agents’ utility functions can be both sufﬁcient and necessary
to guarantee convergence to an optimal allocation by means
of rational 1-deals alone.

Our argument for the inexistence of any such necessary
and sufﬁcient condition has directly exploited the fact that we
were looking for a single condition to be met by the utility
functions of all agents. The problem could be circumvented
by looking for suitable conditions on negotiation problems
as a whole, where different utility functions may meet dif-
ferent such conditions. Clearly, such a condition does exist.
However, the aforementioned result of Dunne et al. [2005] on
the NP-hardness of checking whether there exists a path of
rational 1-deals between two given allocations immediately
suggests that verifying whether a given negotiation problem
meets any such condition would be intractable.

6 The modular class is maximal
We are now going to prove the main result of this paper,
namely the surprising fact that the class of modular utility
functions is not only sufﬁcient for 1-deal negotiation but also
maximal in the sense that no class of utility functions strictly
including the modular functions would still be sufﬁcient for
1-deal negotiation. The signiﬁcance of this result can only be
fully appreciated when considered together with the “nega-
tive” result on necessary and sufﬁcient conditions discussed
in the previous section.

Before stating the main result, we prove the following aux-

iliary lemma:
Lemma 2 (Alternative characterisation of modularity)
A utility function u is modular iff the following holds for all
R ⊆ R and all r1, r2 ∈ R with r1, r2 6∈ R and r1 6= r2:

u(R∪{r1, r2}) = u(R∪{r1})+u(R∪{r2})−u(R) (3)
Proof. To show this, let us recall elementary facts about sub-
modular functions. A function v : R → R is submodular iff
∀R1, R2 ⊆ R, v(R1) + v(R2) ≥ v(R1 ∪ R2) + v(R1 ∩ R2).
It is also known that v is submodular iff v(R∪{r1}) + v(R∪
{r2}) ≥ v(R ∪ {r1, r2}) − v(R) for any R ⊆ R, r1, r2 ∈
R\R, with r1 6= r2 [Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1988, p.662].
Because a function u is modular iff both u and −u are sub-
modular, the lemma holds.

2

We are now in a position to prove our theorem on the max-
imality of the class of modular utility functions with respect
to rational negotiation over one resource at a time:
Theorem 3 (Maximality) Let M be the class of modular
utility functions. Then for any class of utility functions F
such that M ⊂ F, F does not permit 1-deal negotiation.
Proof. First observe that for |R| ≤ 1, any utility function
is modular, i.e. the theorem holds vacuously in these cases.
Therefore, without loss of generality, from now on we assume
that there are at least two distinct resources in the system.

The proof is constructive. We will show that for any non-
modular utility function u1 on m resources, it is possible to
construct a modular utility function u2 (with ui ≡ 0 for all
other agents i) and an initial allocation such that no optimal
allocation can be reached by means of 1-deals. This implies
that M ∪ {u1} does not permit 1-deals.

Because u1 is non-modular, Lemma 2 can be applied in the
following way: there exist a bundle X and distinct resources
r1, r2 /∈ X such that , deﬁned as follows, is not equal to 0:
 = u1(X∪{r1})+u1(X∪{r2})−u1(X)−u1(X∪{r1, r2}) (4)
From now on, A12|, A|12, A1|2 and A2|1 will refer to alloca-
tions in which r1 and r2 belong to one of the ﬁrst two agents,
and in which resources in X are owned by 1, and resources in
Y = R\(X ∪{r1, r2}) by 2, as shown in the following table.

Agent 1

Figure 1: Values of sw for the four allocations (case  > 0).

Figure 2: Values of sw for the four allocations (case  < 0).

Let us build a modular utility function u2 deﬁned as follows:
∀R ∈ R,

u2(R) = X

αr + X

ω − X

ω

(5)

r∈{r1,r2}∩R

r∈R∩Y

r∈R∩X

with ω = 14 × max|u1| + 1. Let Ω = u2(Y ) = |Y | ×
ω. As the rest of the proof shall reveal, the value of ω has
been chosen such that the social welfare of each of these four
allocations is greater than that of any other allocation. Of
course, this will imply that the optimal allocation has to be
among these four. The values of αr1 and αr2 will be chosen
later. The social welfare of each of these four allocations can
then be written as follows:

sw(A|12) = Ω + αr1 + αr2 + u1(X)
sw(A12|) = Ω + u1(X ∪ {r1, r2})
sw(A1|2) = Ω + αr2 + u1(X ∪ {r1})
sw(A2|1) = Ω + αr1 + u1(X ∪ {r2})

It remains to be shown that depending on the value of , we
can always choose an initial allocation among these four and
values of αr1 and αr2 such that (1) this initial allocation does
not have optimal social welfare, (2) there is only one rational
deal from this allocation, (3) this deal leads to the optimal
allocation but however (4) this rational deal would involve
more than one resource. We will have to consider two cases
for equation (4): the case of  > 0 and the case of  < 0.
(1st case) Suppose  > 0. Let us choose αr1 = u1(X ∪
4 and αr2 = u1(X ∪ {r1, r2}) − u1(X ∪
{r1}) − u1(X) − 
{r1}) + 
4 .
Let us ﬁrst show that the four allocations have a greater
social welfare than any other. With the help of equation (4),
observe that both |αr1| and |αr2| are less than 3 × max|u1|.
Thus, all four allocations have a social welfare of at least Ω−
|αr1| − |αr2| − max|u1| ≥ Ω − 7 × max|u1| > Ω − ω
2 .
All other allocations have a social welfare lower than Ω −
ω + |αr1| + |αr2| + max|u1| ≤ Ω − ω + 7 × max|u1| <
Ω− ω
2 . Thus, the social welfare of each of the four allocations
is greater than that of any other allocation.

Now let us show that A2|1 is the optimal allocation, as
illustrated in Figure 1. More precisely, let us show that
sw(A|12) < sw(A1|2), that sw(A12|) < sw(A1|2) and that
sw(A1|2) < sw(A2|1). By substituting the values of αr1 and

αr2 and using equation (4), the social welfare of each alloca-
tion can be written as follows:

sw(A|12) = Ω + u1(X ∪ {r1, r2})
sw(A12|) = Ω + u1(X ∪ {r1, r2})
sw(A1|2) = Ω + u1(X ∪ {r1, r2}) + 
4
sw(A2|1) = Ω + u1(X ∪ {r1}) + u1(X ∪ {r2})

−u1(X) − 
4

3
= Ω + u1(X ∪ {r1, r2}) +
4 
Here, A2|1 is clearly the optimal allocation.
If we choose
A1|2 as the initial allocation, then the only 1-deals involving
resources r1 or r2 are δ(A1|2, A12|) and δ(A1|2, A|12). These
deals decrease social welfare, and thus are not individually
rational by Lemma 1. Thus, it is not possible to reach the
optimal allocation A2|1 starting from A1|2 using only 1-deals.
(2nd case) Suppose  < 0. Let us choose α1 = u1(X ∪
4 and α2 = u1(X ∪ {r2}) − u1(X) − 
{r1}) − u1(X) − 
4 .
Note that again, both |αr1| and |αr2| are less than 3 ×
max|u1|. Thus, by the same argument as in the ﬁrst case,
the four allocations all have greater social welfare than any
other allocation.

The optimal allocation is now A12|. To see this, let us show
that sw(A1|2) < sw(A|12), that sw(A2|1) < sw(A|12), and
that sw(A|12) < sw(A12|) as illustrated in Figure 2.

Here, A12| is clearly the optimal allocation.
If we choose
A|12 as the initial allocation, then the only 1-deals involving

r1 or r2 are δ(A|12, A1|2) and δ(A|12, A2|1). These deals de-
crease social welfare, and thus are not individually rational
by Lemma 1. Thus, it is not possible to reach the optimal
allocation A12| starting from A|12 using only 1-deals.

Why is this result signiﬁcant? As argued earlier, while the
full abstract negotiation framework introduced at the begin-
ning of this paper would be difﬁcult to implement, designing
a system that only allows for pairs of agents to agree on deals
over one resource at a time is entirely feasible. As we would
like to be able to guarantee socially optimal outcomes in as
many cases as possible, also for such a restricted negotiation
system, we would like to be able to identify the largest possi-
ble class of utility functions for which such a guarantee can be
given. However, our discussion in Section 5 has shown that
there can be no class of utility functions that exactly charac-
terises the class of negotiation problems for which negotiat-
ing socially optimal allocations by means of rational 1-deals
is always possible. Still, there are classes of utility functions
that permit 1-deal negotiation. As shown by Theorem 2, the
class of modular functions is such a class and it is a very nat-
ural class to consider. An obvious question to ask is therefore
whether this class can be enlarged in any way without losing
the desired convergence property.

Our proof of Theorem 3 settles this question by giving a
negative answer: For any agent with a non-modular utility
function there exist modular utility functions (for the other
agents) and an initial allocation such that rational 1-deals
alone do not sufﬁce to negotiate an allocation of resources
with maximal social welfare. There may well be further such
classes (that are both sufﬁcient and maximal), but the class of
modular functions is one that is particularly natural and useful
in the context of modelling agent preferences.

7 Conclusion
This paper makes a contribution to the theoretical analysis
of a negotiation framework where rational but myopic agents
agree on a sequence of deals regarding the reallocation of a
number of discrete resources. We have shown that the use of
modular utility functions to model agent preferences is a suf-
ﬁcient condition to guarantee ﬁnal allocations with maximal
social welfare in case agents only negotiate 1-deals (involving
one resource each). We have then seen that this is, however,
not a necessary condition for optimal outcomes and, indeed,
there can be no condition on (individual) utility functions that
would be both necessary and sufﬁcient in this sense. We have
therefore concentrated on showing that the class of modular
functions is maximal, i.e. no strictly larger class of functions
would still permit an optimal allocation to be found by means
of rational 1-deals in all cases.

We consider this not only a surprising result, but also a
useful characterisation of negotiation domains that can be
handled reliably using simple negotiation protocols, catering
only for Contract Net-like deals over single items between
pairs of agents, rather than the full range of multilateral deals
forseen in the abstract framework. Such theoretical results af-
fect both the design of agents and of negotiation mechanisms.
For instance, if a given mechanism can only handle 1-deals,

then it may be inappropriate to design myopic agents with
very rich preference structures to use such a mechanism.

In a companion paper [Chevaleyre et al., 2005], we prove a
generalisation of Theorem 1 which shows that rational deals
involving at most k resources each are sufﬁcient for conver-
gence to an optimal allocation in case all utility functions are
additively separable with respect to a common partition of
R (i.e. synergies across different parts of the partition are not
possible and overall utility is deﬁned as the sum of utilities for
the different sets in the partition [Fishburn, 1970]), and each
set in this partition has at most k elements. The arguments
against the existence of sufﬁcient conditions for negotiation
over k items at a time that are also necessary generalise in the
expected manner. An important issue that remains to be in-
vestigated in the future therefore is to see whether it is possi-
ble to derive a similar maximality property as the one proved
in this paper for this richer class of utility functions.

Another topic for future work would be to investigate what
classes of utility functions are sufﬁcient and maximal for ne-
gotiating socially optimal allocations by means of 1-deals
without side payments.
