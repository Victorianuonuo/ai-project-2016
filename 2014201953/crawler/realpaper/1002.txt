Abstract

Animated text is an appealing ﬁeld of
creative graphical design. Manually
designed text animation is largely em-
ployed in advertising, movie titles and
web pages. In this paper we propose to
link, through state of the art NLP tech-
niques, the affective content detection of
a piece of text to the animation of the
words in the text itself. This methodol-
ogy allows us to automatically generate
affective text animation and opens some
new perspectives for advertising, internet
applications and intelligent interfaces.

Introduction

1
An actor reads a script. He reads those words with the in-
tention of transforming cold print into living speech. Vocal
inﬂections, tone of voice, gestures and facial expressions are
all part of the actor’s contribution to the play. With the body’s
subtle vibrations and frequencies, he expresses the hidden
emotional meaning. We can say that, through his interpre-
tation, he brings the script to life.

In this paper we will show that through automatic detec-
tion of the affective meaning of texts using state of the art
NLP techniques, we can consequently animate the words that
compose them. In automated text animation the text itself is
capable of augmenting its expressivity and of moving in an
autonomous way.

Animated text is widely employed in creative graphical de-
sign. Manually designed text animation has been employed
for a long time in movie titles, television advertisements, and
web pages. Nevertheless there are applied contexts in which
automated text animation would be very useful (e.g. smart
presentation of newspaper headlines or advertising slogans).
As far as we know, there are no tools for the automated ani-
mation of texts.

In this paper, we approach the automated creation of text
animation, linking it to the lexical semantic content (in par-
ticular, to affective meaning). Once the affective load of a
sentence is detected, we check for words that are most seman-
tically similar to emotional concepts and then we emphasize
the affective meaning through an appropriate animation (i.e.

different emotions have different animations). This semantic
similarity function is acquired automatically in an unsuper-
vised way from a large corpus of texts, and it allows us to put
into relation concepts and emotional categories.

We suppose that, if text animation is semantically consis-
tent with text content, the communication of the affective
meaning is more effective. Speciﬁcally, we want to pay atten-
tion to the memorizability of text and how it increases with
a consistent animation. We believe that, beyond the pleas-
antness, affective animations can increase the memorizability
of text and, in particular, the semantic consistency between
words and animations has a signiﬁcant role in the memoriza-
tion of headlines.

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents
resources and functionalities for the recognition of affec-
tive terms. An affective hierarchy as an extension of the
WORDNET-AFFECT lexical database was developed in the
ﬁrst place. The next phase is the development of a seman-
tic similarity function, acquired automatically in an unsuper-
vised way from a large corpus of texts, which allows us to put
into relation words and emotional categories. Section 3 intro-
duces text animation (i.e. kinetic typography) and the devel-
opment of a ﬂexible scripting language to describe and dy-
namically generate text animation. Section 4 shows an evalu-
ation and Section 5 discusses some conclusive remarks.

2 Affective Semantic Similarity
All words can potentially convey affective meaning. Each of
them, even those more apparently neutral, can evoke pleas-
ant or painful experiences, because of their semantic relation
with emotional concepts. While some words have emotional
meaning with respect to the individual story, for many others
the affective power is part of the collective imagination (e.g.
words “mum”, “ghost”, “war” etc.).

We are interested in this second group, because their af-
fective meaning is part of common sense knowledge and can
be detected in the linguistic usage. For this reason, we stud-
ied the use of words in textual productions, and in particular
their co-occurrences with the words in which the affective
meaning is explicit. As claimed by Ortony et al. [Ortony et
al., 1987], we have to distinguish between words directly re-
ferring to emotional states (e.g. “fear”, “cheerful”) and those
having only an indirect reference that depends on the context
(e.g. words that indicate possible emotional causes as “killer”

Table 1: Some of emotional categories in WORDNET-AFFECT and some corresponding word senses

or emotional responses as “cry”). We call the former direct
affective words and the latter indirect affective words [Strap-
parava et al., 2006].

In order to manage affective lexical meaning, we (i)
organized the direct affective words and synsets inside
WORDNET-AFFECT, an affective lexical resource based on
an extension of WORDNET, and (ii) implemented a selection
function (named affective weight) based on a semantic simi-
larity mechanism automatically acquired in an unsupervised
way from a large corpus of texts (100 millions of words), in
order to individuate the indirect affective lexicon.

Applied to a concept (e.g. a WORDNET synset) and an
emotional category, this function returns a value represent-
ing the semantic afﬁnity with that emotion. In this way it is
possible to assign a value to the concept with respect to each
emotional category, and eventually select the emotion with
the highest value. Applied to a set of concepts that are se-
mantically similar, this function selects subsets characterized
by some given affective constraints (e.g. referring to a partic-
ular emotional category or valence).

As we will see, we are able to focus selectively on positive,
negative, ambiguous or neutral types of emotions. For exam-
ple, given “difﬁculty” as input term, the system suggests as
IDENTIFICATION, NEGATIVE-CONCERN,
related emotions:
AMBIGUOUS-EXPECTATION, APATHY. Moreover, given an
input word (e.g. “university”) and the indication of an emo-
tional valence (e.g. positive), the system suggests a set of re-
lated words through some positive emotional category (e.g.
“professor” “scholarship” “achievement”) found through the
emotions ENTHUSIASM, SYMPATHY, DEVOTION, ENCOUR-
AGEMENT.

This ﬁne-grained affective lexicon selection can open up
new possibilities in many applications that exploit verbal
communication of emotions. For example, [Valitutti et al.,
2005] exploited the semantic connection between a generic
word and an emotion for the generation of affective evalua-
tive predicates and sentences.

2.1 WORDNET-AFFECT and the Emotional

Categories

WORDNET-AFFECT is an extension of the WordNet database
[Fellbaum, 1998], including a subset of synsets suitable to
represent affective concepts. Similarly to what was done for
domain labels [Magnini and Cavagli`a, 2000], one or more
affective labels (a-labels) are assigned to a number of Word-

Net synsets. In particular, the affective concepts representing
an emotional state are individuated by synsets marked with
the a-label EMOTION. There are also other a-labels for those
concepts representing moods, situations eliciting emotions, or
emotional responses. WORDNET-AFFECT is freely available
for research purpose at http://wndomains.itc.it.
See [Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004] for a complete descrip-
tion of the resource.

Table 2: Number of elements in the emotional hierarchy.

Recently, we extended WORDNET-AFFECT with a set of
additional a-labels (i.e. the emotional categories), hierarchi-
cally organized, in order to specialize synsets with a-label
EMOTION.
In a second stage, we introduced some modi-
ﬁcations, in order to distinguish synsets according to emo-
tional valence. We deﬁned four additional a-labels: POS-
ITIVE, NEGATIVE, AMBIGUOUS, NEUTRAL. The ﬁrst one
corresponds to “positive emotions”, deﬁned as emotional
states characterized by the presence of positive edonic sig-
nals (or pleasure).
It includes synsets such as joy#1 or
enthusiasm#1. Similarly the NEGATIVE a-label identiﬁes
“negative emotions” characterized by negative edonic signals
(or pain), for example anger#1 or sadness#1. Synsets
representing affective states whose valence depends on se-
mantic context (e.g. surprise#1) were marked with the
tag AMBIGUOUS. Finally, synsets referring to mental states
that are generally considered affective but are not character-
ized by valence, were marked with the tag NEUTRAL.
2.2 Computing Lexical Affective Semantic

Similarity

There is an active research direction in the NLP ﬁeld about
sentiment analysis and recognition of semantic orientation
from texts (e.g. [Turney and Littman, 2003; Liu et al., 2003;
Mihalcea and Liu, 2006]). In our opinion, a crucial issue is
to have a mechanism for evaluating the semantic similarity
among generic terms and affective lexical concepts. To this

IJCAI-07

1720

aim we estimated term similarity from a large scale corpus.
In particular we implemented a variation of Latent Semantic
Analysis (LSA) in order to obtain a vector representation for
words, texts and synsets.

In LSA [Deerwester et al., 1990], second order relations
among terms and documents of the corpus are captured by
means of a dimensionality reduction operated by a Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) on the term-by-document ma-
trix. For the experiments reported in this paper, we run the
SVD operation on the full British National Corpus1.

SVD is a well-known operation in linear algebra, which
can be applied to any rectangular matrix in order to ﬁnd cor-
relations among its rows and columns. SVD decomposes
the term-by-document matrix T into three matrices T =
UΣkVT where Σk is the diagonal k × k matrix containing
the k singular values of T, σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ . . . ≥ σk, and U and
V are column-orthogonal matrices. When the three matrices
are multiplied together the original term-by-document matrix
is re-composed. Typically we can choose k(cid:2) (cid:3) k obtaining
the approximation T (cid:4) UΣk(cid:2)VT . More speciﬁcally, in the
experiments for this paper we use the matrix T(cid:2) = UΣk(cid:2),
whose rows represent the term vectors in the reduced space,
taking into account the ﬁrst 100 dimensions (i.e. k(cid:2) = 100).
LSA can be viewed as a way to overcome some of the
drawbacks of the standard vector space model (sparseness
and high dimensionality). In fact, the LSA similarity is com-
puted in a lower dimensional space, in which second-order
relations among terms and texts are exploited. The similarity
in the resulting vector space can be measured with the stan-
dard cosine similarity. Note also that LSA yields a vector
space model that allows for a homogeneous representation
(and hence comparison) of words, word sets, sentences and
texts.

For representing word sets and texts by means of a LSA
vector, we used a variation of the pseudo-document method-
ology described in [Berry, 1992]. This variation takes into
account also a tf-idf weighting schema (see [Gliozzo and
Strapparava, 2005] for more details). In practice, each doc-
ument can be represented in the LSA space by summing up
the normalized LSA vectors of all the terms contained in it.
Also a synset in WORDNET (and then an emotional category)
can be represented in the LSA space, performing the pseudo-
document technique on all the words contained in the synset.
Thus it is possible to have a vectorial representation of each
emotional category in the LSA space (i.e. the emotional vec-
tors), and consequently we can compute a similarity measure
among terms and affective categories. We deﬁned the affec-
tive weight as the similarity value between an emotional vec-
tor and an input term vector (e.g. we can check how a generic
term is similar to a given emotion).

For example, the noun “gift” is highly related to the emo-
tional categories: LOVE (with positive valence), COMPAS-
SION (with negative valence), SURPRISE (with ambiguous va-
lence), and INDIFFERENCE (with neutral valence).

In summary, the vectorial representation in the Latent Se-

1The British National Corpus is a very large (over 100 million
words) corpus of modern English, both spoken and written (see
http://www.hcu.ox.ac.uk/bnc/).

mantic Space allows us to represent, in a uniform way, emo-
tional categories, generic terms and concepts (synsets), and
eventually full sentences. See [Strapparava et al., 2006] for
more details.

For example, Table 3 displays some news titles (taken from
the CNN and Google News sites), the respective more similar
affective category, the affective weight, and the word in the
title most similar to that category. In the next section we will
see that this functionality is the basis for indicating which
words to animate and in which way.

3 Text Animation
Kinetic typography is the technology of text animation, i.e.
text that uses movement or other changes over time.

The advantage of kinetic typography consists in a further
communicative dimension, combining verbal and visual com-
munication, and providing opportunities to enrich the expres-
siveness of static texts. According to [Lee et al., 2002], ki-
netic typography can be used for three different communica-
tive goals: capturing and directing attention of recipients, cre-
ating characters, and expressing emotions. A possible way of
animating a text is mimicking the typical movement of hu-
mans when they express the content of the text (e.g. “Hi”
with a jumping motion mimics exaggerated body motion of
humans when they are really glad).

We explore the idea to have a link between lexical se-
mantics of texts (automatically discerned through NLP tech-
niques) and some kinetic properties exploited for animating
the words. In this paper, we consider affective connotation
of texts by exploiting the affective semantic similarity intro-
duced above. This holds particularly for “indirect affective
words” [Strapparava et al., 2006]. For example, these words
may indicate possible emotional causes (e.g. “monster”) or
emotional responses (e.g. “cry”). Thus kinetic typography
allows us to make the indirect affective meaning explicit in
order to automatically augment the affective expressivity of
texts.

A ﬁrst step was the individuation of an appropriate tool for
the authoring and visualization of text animations. In partic-
ular, we wanted to act in an environment that allows us to
realize animations in a very simple manner and to represent
them in a easily exportable format. Functionalities for the
automated composition of animations were our speciﬁc con-
cern. To this aim we considered the Kinetic Typography En-
gine (KTE), a Java package developed at the Design School
of Carnegie Mellon University [Lee et al., 2002]. It allows
us to create a potentially wide range of animations. Taking
this engine as a starting point, we ﬁrst realized a development
environment for the creation and the visualization of text an-
imations. Our model for the animation representation is a bit
simpler than the KTE model. The central assumption con-
sists of the representation of the animation as a composition
of elementary animations (e.g. linear, sinusoidal or exponen-
tial variation). In particular, we consider only one operator
for the identiﬁcation of elementary animations (K-BASE) and
three composition operators: kinetic addition (K-ADD), ki-
netic concatenation (K-JOIN), and kinetic loop (K-LOOP).

The K-BASE operator selects an elementary animation

The kinetic addition (K-ADD) of two animations with the
same start time is obtained by adding, for each kinetic prop-
erty of text, the corresponding dynamical variation of each
single animation. The kinetic concatenation (K-JOIN) con-
sists in the temporal shifting of the second animation, so that
the ending time of the ﬁrst is the starting time of the second.
The kinetic loop (K-LOOP) concatenates an animation with
itself a ﬁxed number of times. In the development environ-
ment it is possible to freely apply these operators for the real
time building of new animations. Compositional structure of
animations can be represented in XML format and then easily
exported. Finally, an interpreter allows us to generate in real
time the animation starting from its structural representation.

3.1 Affective Animation
After building the development tool, we selected a set of emo-
tional categories and, for each of them, we created the corre-
sponding text animations.

In particular, we focused on ﬁve emotional categories: joy,
fear, surprise, anger, sadness (i.e. a subset of Ekman emotions
[Ekman, 1977]).

The kinetic animation to associate to a ﬁxed emotion can
be realized imitating either emotional and physiological ren-
sponses (analogous motion technique), or tone of voice. We
consider only animations of the ﬁrst type, i.e. we represent
each emotion with an animation that simulates a particular

a sequence of hops, FEAR with palpitations, ANGER with a
strong tremble and blush, SURPRISE with a sudden swelling
of text, and ﬁnally SADNESS with text deﬂaction and getting
squashed. Thus we annotated the corresponding emotional
categories in WORDNET-AFFECT with these kinematic prop-
erties.

Figure 1 displays in detail the behavior of the anger emo-
tion, showing the time-dependent composition graph of the
basic animations. The string appears (1) and disappears (8)
with a linear variation of the alpha property (that deﬁnes the
transparency of a color and can be represented by a ﬂoat
value). The animation is contained between these two inter-
vals and its duration is 1500 ms. The ﬁrst component is a
tiny random variation of the position (2) (3), represented by
x and y kinetic properties, with jitter behavior. The second
component consists of an expansion of the string (4) and a
subsequent compression (5). The third component is given
by a slow rise up (6). The last component, before disappear-
ing, is a color change to red (7). The whole behavior is then
described and implemented using the scripting language in-
troduced above.

In addition to affective animations, we also realized a set
of neutral ones, in order to visualize the part of text that is not
related to emotions, for example to realize transition effects.
3.2 Automated Generation of Animations
Emotional and neutral animations are the results of creative
design and constitute the basic ingredients for the automatic
building of more complex animations. This process can be
regarded as an operation of script assembling. Here, the
key idea is to automatize the composition of text animation
through the automated recognition of the affective connota-
tion and its representation via kinetic typography.

The animation algorithm is based on two steps: the auto-
mated recognition of the emotion and the representation of
emotion by text animation. This is realized with the selection
of the text fragments to animate, the association of the cor-
responding animations, and eventually the concatenation of
component animations in a fully integrated one. Part of au-
tomatization depends on text form (in particular, length and
punctuation), while another part (the main one) depends on

In sum, the algorithm we follow in the case of headlines

1. given a headline, using the lexical affective semantic
similarity technique, check for the most similar emo-
tional category (see Table 3);

2. mark the words in the headline that are closer to that

emotional category;

3. assign to each word in the headline a neutral or an affec-
tive animation, corresponding to the affective weight of
the word;

4. assemble a comprehensive animation script, and display

4 Evaluation
We conducted an exploratory evaluation of memorization, af-
fective coherence and pleasantness of the animated headlines.
We involved ten people. The experiments were organized as
follows.
• we showed to each person ﬁve static headlines in a serial
manner (with an interval of 3 seconds between each. Af-
ter a pause of a couple of minutes we asked the subject to
recognize the ﬁve headlines among a list of 50 news ti-
tles. Afterwards we repeated this experiment with ﬁve
animated headlines (of course with a different set of
news titles). All the users were able to recognize the an-
imated headlines faster, with a mean of 47.5% less time
in ﬁnding the animated headlines.
• we asked the users to annotate a set of generated ani-
mations choosing from the following emotional labels:
joy, fear, anger, sadness, surprise, and possibly no-label.
The agreement with the automatic annotation was about
72%.
• 80% of the users declared they really appreciated the an-

imated titles.

In addition, we created a set of “inconsistent” animations
(e.g. some titles animated with a kinetic script not related to
the respective emotional category). We repeated the ﬁrst ex-
periment. It is interesting to note that in this case the users
performance in ﬁnding the headlines among a list of 50 news
titles was even worse than the case of static headlines3.

3We also asked the users to annotate these inconsistent anima-
tions. The general feeling reported was that of an annoying disori-
entation, in addition to the fact that the agreement was quite low

5 Conclusions and Future Work
This work has been about “giving life” to texts, automatically.
The idea is that we can combine two main elements: (i) au-
tomatic recognition of the emotion evoked by a text and by
speciﬁc lexical entries; (ii) an automatic way to produce an-
imation with kinetic typography, given the text and the en-
tries speciﬁcally marked in the ﬁrst phase. Each emotion
in WORDNET-AFFECT (an extension of WORDNET with af-
fective labels on synsets) is annotated with some kinematic
properties that simulate a particular emotional behavior. The
mechanism involves a LSA-based similarity processing so
that an emotion can be attributed to the text and to individ-
ual words. The realization of the animation is done through
an underlying package for kinetic typography, so that the pro-
cess develops automatically. Of course the ﬁrst phase can be
coupled with a different expressive mechanism, such as an
embodied conversational agent with good prosody in its text-
to-speech component and appropriate facial expression, but
we think that the role of the written text is very important
and we want to exploit its potential. Many things can be im-
proved. For instance, a more thorough analysis of the text
can lead to more elaborated structuring of the animation. Or
personalisation can be brought in: for instance named enti-
ties can have a personalised valence that inﬂuences the anal-
ysis and animation. Or we can aim at recognizing irony in
the text (for some preliminary work on recognizing humor-
ous text, see [Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2005]) and express
it appropriately. Basically, the presented work is meant to
automatically produce what human graphic designers some-
times do for TV presentation of certain types of headlines, as
in the examples of application of our work in this paper; or
what is done on a much larger scale in the world of advertis-
ing. To emphasize the potential relevance of a system of this
kind, it should be noted that Internet advertising was evalu-
ated at $9.4 billion (8,000 million euro) in 2004 according to
Kagan Research LLC. And growth is very fast: Google adver-
tisement revenues went from 0 to 3,400 million euro in ﬁve
years according to Business Week. This scenario calls for a
strong role for computer-based intelligent technology for au-
tomatically producing novel appropriate advertisements. Fu-
ture advertisements need to be ﬂexible, and possibly depend
on variable input, such as new, not previously processed text.
