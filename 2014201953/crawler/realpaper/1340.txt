the  f i r st  attempts  to

the  problem  description  and  a  reduction  in 
the  number  of  different  names  for  the  ele­

down

the  t o t al  problem  (how  to  win  in  chess),

subproblems.  Of  course,  as  this  heuristic 
is  formulated  on  the  basis  of  some  local

in  chess), 

One  of  the  most  interesting  problems 
showing  the  importance  of  a  good  representa­
t i on  is  the  "Tough  But"  problem.1.2  The 
problem,  b r i e f l y, 
is  to  prove  the  impossibi­
l i ty  of  f u l ly  covering  a  chessboard,  with 
two  diagonally  opposite  squares  removed, 
using  domino  pieces.  The  black/white  colo­
r i ng  of  the  board  leads  to  the  simple 
solution. 
coloring  of  the  board  in  t h is  case  is  simply 
an  " i n s i g h t"  which  is  a  rather  natural 
thing  for  a  person  f a m i l i ar  w i th  the  chess-

One  could  reason  that  the  successful 

Here  we  w i ll  t r y,  however,  to  look  at 
t h is  matter  from  a  different  point  of  view 

and  to  show  how  one  could  "make  a  guess" 
about  the  board  coloring,  without  appeal  to 
purely  human  experience. 
The  d i f f i c u l ty  of  the  Tough  Nut  problem 
in  i ts  i n i t i al  formulation  l i es  in  the  fact 
that  one  is  given  with  the  board  description 
simply  as  a  two-dimensional  f i e ld

unclear  because  the  end  result  is  not  easily 
seen.

Indeed,  the  only  way  to  describe  our 

actions  (positioning  of  the  pieces  on  the 
board)  is  to  display  the  names  (  C.■  )  of 
the  o r i g i n al  formulation 
covered  c e l l s. 
of  the  problem  a ll  of  the  cells  have  d i f f e­
rent  names.  Such  a  naming  allows  only 
the 
strategy  of  solving  the  problem  using  a 
complete  search  and  does  not  serve  as  a  base 
f or  pruning  the  search  tree. 
From  this  point  of  view, 
somehow  reducing  the  number  of  different 
names  seems  to  be  very  reasonable,  as  it 
could  bring  out  some  information  about 
" i d e n t i c a l"  positionings.  In  other  words, 
we  see  that  the  only  way  to  achieve  a  more 
or  less  uniform  description  of  our  actions 
is  to  reduce  the  number  of  names  used. 

the  idea  of 

The  extreme  case:  one  name  is  used  for 
a ll  of  the  c e l l s.  This  gives  ua  a  highly 
uniform  description  because  our  different 
actions  (positionings)  d i f f er  only  in  the 
number  of  covered  c e l l s.  This  naming  obvious­
ly  could  help  one  only  in  solution  of  the 
simplest  problems. 
Using  two  names  one  could  get  a  less  t r i­
v i al  but  nevertheless  a  very  uniform  descri­
ption  of  the  following  s i t u a t i o n:  "a  domino 
is  put  somewhere  on  the  board."  It  is  easy 
to  see  that  it  could  be  achieved  only  for 
a  certain  assignment  of  the  two  names  to 
cells—namely  chess  assignment.  Then  we

In  a ll 

the  problems  below  we  w i ll  follow 
our  chain  of  reasoning—using  a  small  number 
of  different  names  for  elements  of  a  problem 
and  then  getting  a  certain  assignment  of  the 
names  to  different  elements  in  a  way  which 
w i ll  give  us  an  invariant  description  of 
our  actions.  We'll  see  that  the  procedure 
of  assignment  has  a  very  simple  "algorithmic" 
character. 

1.  Let  us  decide  to  present  a  certain

array  of  square  cells  as  a  sum  of  elements 
not  of  the  "domino"  form 

as  in  the  Tough  Hut  problem,  but  of  the  form 

Here  the  chessboard  consideration  can  not 
be  d i r e c t ly  applied.  However,  using  two 
names  0 , 1,  one  could  achieve,  for  instance, 
the  following  invariant  description:

and  sufficient  to  get  a  corresponding  colo(cid:173)
ring  of  the  following 

3 x3  array: 

2,  In  the  same  manner  it  can  be  shown  that 

it  is  impossible, 

in  case  of  hexagonal  cells 
using  the  blocks 

With  this  description  it  is  easy  to  show  the 
impossibility  of  building  the  array 

"to  b u i l d"  from  them  the  following  array  of 
such  c e l l s,  both  using  two  or  three  names: 

using  a  combination  of  "enlarged  c e l l s" 

Obviously,  we  could  not  get  an  invariant 
description  in  this  case  using  more  than 
three  names  tor  the  c e l l s.  .For  three  names 
0,1,2  one  can  get  the  following  invariant 
"coloring" 

which  also  indicates  that  a  combination  of 
such  cells  could  not  be  used  to  construct 
the  following  array 

that: 

Obviously  we  need  not  consider  bricks  so

that  they  are  not  p a r a l l el  to  the  aides  of 
the  cube.  S i m i l a r i l y,  a  brick  should  be 
positioned  only  in  an  n-unit  distance  from 
the  sides  (n  =  0,1,2,3).  Taking  t h is  into 
account  we  can  consider  an  assertion  equiva(cid:173)
lent  to  the  previous  one: 
"A  6  x  6  x  6  cube,  composed  from  1 x 1 x1 
subcubes  cannot  be  presented  as  a  sum  of 
blocks  of  the  subcubes  which  are 
in  size." 
Using  two  names  ("black"  and  "white")  f or 
subcubes  we  easily  come,  f or  instance,  to 
the  following  Invariant  descriptions  (again,

it  is  s u f f i c i e nt  to  consider  a  4  x  4  x  4

enlarged  elements 

It  is  obvious  that  with  such  blocks  one  could 
not  f i nd  a  n o n - t r i v i al  invariant  description 
of  the  array 

So  in  t h is  way  we  unable  to  show  that  the

considerations  do  not  permit  one  to  get  the 
"global  answer."  Bote, 
that  in  a ll  examples 
used  in  t h is  paper  we  used  the  idea  of 
getting  an  invariant  description  in  the 
Btage  of  assignment  of  small  number  of 
names  to  different  elements.  Of  course,  some 
other  considerations(like  simmetry)  could  be 
used  too.  Though  these  considerations  are 
beyond  of  the  scope  of  present  paper,  and 
w i ll  be  given  somewhere  else. 

5.  Anticipating  one  of  the  possible 
questions  concerning  the  l a st  case,  we  w i ll 
give  one  example  more*  Considering  the 
following  enlarged  blocks 

with  the  same  local  approach  we  could  achieve 
as  an  invariant  description  the  chessboard 
coloring  that  shows 
to 
build  from  such  blocks  either  of  the  two  f o l(cid:173)
lowing  arrays; 

that  it  is  impossible 

The  l a t t er  description  obviously  does  prove 
the  assertion,  as  the  number  of  black  and 
white  subcubes  are  not  equal.

An  approach  to  this  problem  in 

is  one 
that  we  c a ll  " i n s i g h t ."  Indeed,  the  solution 
of  the  problem  there  is  introduced  with  the 
phrase:  "Imagine  the  cube  to  be  made  up  of 
2x2x2 
the 
coordinates 
in  the 
usual  way.  Color  black  the  cubes  whose 
coordinates  add  up  to  be  an  odd  number; 
color  the  remaining  cubes  white."

interesting  to  note  that  quite  s i m i l a r ly  the

"Tough  Nut  problem"  in 
beginning  is  referred  to  as  "the  checkerboard

4.  We  saw  that  the  received  description 
does  not  always  help  one  in  decision  making. 
Moreover,  does  not  always  exists  even  one

an  example,  consider  the  problem  of  building

Note  on  the  "Chessboard  Coloring" 

The  following  discussion  is  based  mainly 
on  the  author's  i n t u i t i o n,  and  is  not  v i t al 
to  the  rest  of  the  paper. 
Previously  we  have  mentioned  that  it  is 
natural  to  think  that 
is  the  chessboard 
that  gave  us  a  hint  of  how  to  solve  the 
Tough  Nut  problem1.  We  t r i ed  above  to  show 
that  one  could  come  to  the  idea  of  proper 
coloring  from  the  purely  local  consideration 
in  w r i t i ng  down  the  results  of  our  actions 
while  problem  solving.

Maybe  it  would  be  interesting  to  think

very  necessary.  Indeed,  in  a ll  modern  chess 
playing  computer  programs  3 
this  black-and 
-white  coloring  usually  appears  only  on  a 
computer  display  f or  the  convenience  of  human 
beings  and  it  is  not  taken  into  account  in 
the  computer  program  i t s e l f,  even  though  in 
chess  theory  there  exists  notions  of,  for 
example,  the  b l a c k - f i e ld  bishop  and  white-
- f i e ld  bishop.  However, 
bishop  always  w i ll  keep  track  of  the  black 
f i e ld  even  if  it  doesn't  see 
Below  we  w i ll  give  one  of  the  possible 
considerations,  explaining  how  such  a  colo­
ring  could  follow  again  from  the  local  con­
sideration  of  reducing  the  number  of  d i f f e­
rent  names  used  f or  the  chessboard  f i e l d s. 
(In  computer  programs  we  have  64  names  for 
the  c e l l s.  In  common  chess  notation,  used, 
for  instance,  in  the  USSR,  each  row  is  numbe­
red  ( 1 , 2 , . . . , 8 ),  and  each  column  has  a  l e t t er 
name  ( a , b , c , d , e , f , g , h ) .) 
Note  f i r st  that  the  white  player  in  chess 
has  an  advantage  of  one  moveI  However,  it 
would  not  be  true  to  say  that  white  usually 
wins. 
We  think  that  the  reason  for  it  l i es  in 
the  fact  that  the  first-move-advantage  is 
p a r t i a l ly  compensated  for  by  the  i n i t i al  po­
s i t i o n i ng  of  chess  pieces,  which  is  not 
perfectly  symmetrical.  The  i n i t i al  position 
is  only  mirror  simmetrical  (the  kings  are 
opposite  each  other).(The  author  discussed 
that  hypothesis  with  an  experienced  chess 
player,  who  noticed  that  he  f e lt  that  in 
a  central  symmetrical  chess  game  the  move  of 
the  white  king  pawn  could  almost  surely  lead 
to  a  win.  Unfortunately,  at  this  time,  we 
haven't  any  experimental  v e r i f i c a t i on  of 
t h is  supposition.) 
in  chess  there  is  only  mirror  symmetry. 
quires  a  certain  convention  on  how  each  play­
er  should  put  his  pieces  on  the  chessboard. 
It 
for  black-
-and-white  boards  this  convention  has  the 
most  simple  form,  allowing  partners  to  put 
their  pieces  on  the  board  independently 
(otherwise,  we  have  to  use  more  than  two

So,  we  beleive  that  we  gave  an  unswer  why

to  see,that 

We  are  now  going  to  consider  the  represen­

tation  problem  f or  quite  a  different  area— 
that  of  t r a f f ic  in  the  c i t y.  We  w i ll  see 
that  the  idea  of  using  a  small  number  of 
names  for  elements  is  applicable  here  too,and 

615 

that  concrete  assignment  of  the  names  could 
be  again  founded  from  local  attemta  to  solve 
the  problem  ( l i ke  positioning  of  a  piece  in 
Tough  Nut)  and  a  desire  to  get  uniform  descri­
ption  of  our  actions.  The  main  difference 
from  the  previous  problems  we  see  in  the  fact 
that  here  "names"  have  quite  an  obvious  physi­
cal  interpretation.  This  makes  the  t r a f f ic 
problem  more  related  to  other  problems  of 
local  control.4 

In  the  last  paragraph  we  w i ll  give  a  table 

of  correspondence  between  the  two  classes 
of  problems. 

1.  Imagine  a  c i ty  with  cars  of  two  kinds— 
taxis  and  others,  A  taxicab  that  knows  a p r i-
o ri  the  exact  location  of  demands  (therefore 
for  him  there  is  no  problem  of"search  for 
a  demand")  w i ll  be  considered  to  be  a  non-
- t a x i.  That  i s,  in  accordance  with  our  d e f i­
n i t i o n,  a  free  taxicab  must  Bearch  for  de­
mands  and  be  ignorant  of  demand  locations. 
We  w i ll  consider  below  only  this  i d e a l i s t ic 
taxi  problem. 
The  most  detailed  description  for  thiB 
problem  (analogous  to  that  for  the  Tough  Nut 
problem)  is  the  case  where  a ll  the  carB  in 
the  c i ty  (taxi  and  non-taxi)  have  individual 
names  (for  instance 
numbers). 
t i o n ),  a ll  the  cars  are  indistinguishable. 
Limiting  them 
think  about  their  appropriate  assignment. 
The  action  here  is  the  choice  of  direction 
for  a  free  t a xi  when  it  approaches  a  street 
crossing.  Let  us  consider  one  croee-street. 
Locally, 
if  one  of  the 
taxis  has  Just  l e ft  the  place  where  it  r e­
ceived  a  passenger  and  it  comes  across  a 
free  t a x i,

that  the  car  he  has  just 
met  is  a  t a x i,  and,

, 

So  from  this  local  consideration,  it 
follows  that  for  the  choice  of  actions 
(direction)  one  might  use  the  following 
names: 

*  =  non-taxi 
0  =  free  taxi 
1  =  occupied  t a xi 

Taking  into  account  these  names,  we  could

is  only  a  heuristic  idea,  gained  from  purely 
local  considerations,  and  it  is  not  clear 
now  whether  it  would  work  for  the  problem 
as  a  whole.

computer  of  the  University  of  Washington.  We 
w i ll  not  present  here  the  details  of  the 
program.  As  an  example  ,  downtown  Seattle 
was  used,  with  appropriate  ("natural") 
locations  of  demand  (figures  near  street 
crossings  at  the  picture  at  the  end  of

We  need  not  consider

we  could  automatical(cid:173)
