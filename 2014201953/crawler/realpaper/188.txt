Abstract

This paper deals with iterated revision of partially
ordered information. The (cid:2)rst part of this paper
concerns the Katsuno-Mendelzon’s postulates: we
(cid:2)rst point out that these postulates are not fully sat-
isfactory since only a class of partially ordered in-
formation can be revised. We then propose a suit-
able de(cid:2)nition of faithful assignment, followed by
a new set of postulates and a representation theo-
rem. The second part of this paper investigates ad-
ditional postulates dedicated to iterated revision op-
erators of partially ordered information. Three ex-
tensions of well-known iterated belief revision op-
erations for dealing with partially ordered informa-
tion are brie(cid:3)y presented.

1 Introduction
Belief revision is a central topic in databases, philosophy and
arti(cid:2)cial intelligence. The revision of a database consists of
the insertion of some new information while preserving con-
sistency.

This process has been discussed in different frameworks
(probability theory, Spohn’s ordinal conditional functions,
Grove’s systems of spheres, possibility theory, etc.) and from
different points of view (axiomatization [Alchourr·on et al.,
1985; Katsuno and Mendelzon, 1991], computational issue,
etc.). The proposal of Alchourr·on, G¤ardenfors and Makinson
(AGM) [Alchourr·on et al., 1985] represents one of the most
in(cid:3)uential work. It concerns revision operations that revise
a theory (representing agent’s current beliefs) with a formula
(representing new pieces of information). The AGM frame-
work consists in a set of natural postulates that any revision
operation should satisfy.

An important issue is that any revision operator satisfy-
ing AGM’s postulates is implicitly based on a priority or-
dering. This result suggests that an agent’s epistemic state,
denoted by (cid:9), is something more complex than a simple rep-
resentation of agent’s current beliefs (called belief set and de-
noted by Bel((cid:9))). It also contains strategies to revise his be-
liefs. The AGM’s postulates have been largely studied and/or
adapted in the literature. For instance, additional postulates
have been proposed to manage the concept of iterated belief
change in [Darwiche and Pearl, 1997] (see also [Rott, 2001;
Lehmann, 1995; Nayak, 1994; Konieczny and Pino P·erez,

2000]). More generally, iterated revision is applied to an epis-
temic state, instead of a belief set, and the result is also an
epistemic state.

Epistemic states are often represented by total pre-orders
on possible worlds (or interpretations), denoted by (cid:20)(cid:9). The
set of models of Bel((cid:9)) are identi(cid:2)ed to be minimal (i.e,
preferred) elements with respect to (cid:20)(cid:9).

There is another issue in belief revision and which has been
less investigated in the literature: the iterated revision of epis-
temic states represented by partial pre-orders (instead of to-
tal pre-orders) [Katsuno and Mendelzon, 1991]. Partial pre-
orders offer more (cid:3)exibility than total pre-orders to represent
incomplete knowledge.

Katsuno and Mendelzon proposed in section 5 of [Katsuno
and Mendelzon, 1991], a set of postulates and a representa-
tion theorem that characterize revision operations based on
partial pre-orders. Unfortunately, the proposed approach is
not satisfactory since only one class of partial pre-orders can
be revised. For instance, assume that we have a partial pre-
order (cid:22)(cid:9) on four possible interpretations f!0; !1; !2; !3g,
such that !0 is (cid:147)strictly preferred(cid:148) to !1 and !1 is (cid:147)strictly
preferred(cid:148) to !2 but !3 is incomparable with !0, !1 and !2
(cf. (cid:2)gure 1, for sake of clarity, re(cid:3)exivity and transitivity are
not represented). Clearly, !0 and !3 characterize (are mod-
els of) agent’s currents beliefs Bel((cid:9)) (no interpretation is
strictly preferred to !0 or to !3), but (cid:22)(cid:9) is not a faithful as-
signment in the sense of [Katsuno and Mendelzon, 1991].

More generally, there is no consistent propositional for-
mula that admits (cid:22)(cid:9) of Figure 1 as a faithful assignment. In

fact, faithful assignment requires that each model of agent’s
current beliefs (namely Bel((cid:9))) should be strictly preferred
to each counter-model of agent’s current beliefs. This re-
quirement is appropriate for total pre-orders, but is too strong
for partial pre-orders.

This paper investigates iterated belief revision of partially
ordered information. Its main contributions can be summa-

rized as follows:

(cid:15) We propose an alternative de(cid:2)nition of faithful assign-
ment and an alternative set of natural postulates for re-
vising partially ordered information.

(cid:15) We provide a representation theorem for iterated revi-

sion operators satisfying this new set of postulates.

(cid:15) We investigate additional postulates dedicated to iterated
belief revision. In particular, we discuss the extension
of Darwiche and Pearl’s postulates, Boutilier’s postulate
and we propose two alternative postulates for capturing
other forms of iterated belief revision.

(cid:15) Lastly, we illustrate our results with three well-known
operators (revision with memory, possibilistic revision
and natural belief revision) for revising partially ordered
information.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
presents the Katsuno and Mendelzon’s postulates for belief
revision. Section 3 contains a modi(cid:2)cation of these postu-
lates. Section 4 characterizes Darwiche and Pearl’s postu-
lates and Boutilier’s postulate for iterated belief revision with
partially ordered information. Lastly, Section 5 proposes two
alternative additional postulates and provides three examples
of operators that satisfy the proposed postulates.

2 Notations and KM postulates
2.1 Notations
In this paper we use propositional calculus, denoted by L, as
knowledge representation language with usual connectives :,
^, _, !, (cid:17) (logical equivalence). The lower case letters a,
b, c, (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) , are used to denote propositional variables and lower
case Greeks letters ’,  , (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) , are used to denote formulas. We
denote by (cid:10) the set of interpretations of L and by M od( )
the set of models of a formula  , that is M od( ) = f! 2
(cid:10); ! j=  g. Upper case Greeks letters (cid:9), (cid:8) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) , are used to
denote epistemic states.

A partial pre-order, denoted by (cid:22), on a set A is a re(cid:3)exive
and transitive binary relation. Let x; y 2 A, we de(cid:2)ne the
equality x = y iff x (cid:22) y and y (cid:22) x. The corresponding strict
partial pre-order associated with (cid:22), denoted by (cid:30), is de(cid:2)ned
as usual: x (cid:30) y iff x (cid:22) y holds but x (cid:22) y does not hold. We
denote by (cid:24) the incomparability relation, namely x (cid:24) y iff
neither x (cid:22) y nor y (cid:22) x holds.

Given (cid:22) on a set A, the set of the minimal elements of A,
denoted by M in(A; (cid:22)), is de(cid:2)ned by M in(A; (cid:22)) = fx :
x 2 A; @y 2 A; y (cid:30) xg.
2.2 The KM postulates for belief revision
Katsuno and Mendelzon proposed in [Katsuno and Mendel-
zon, 1991] a reformalization of the well-known AGM postu-
lates [Alchourr·on et al., 1985]. In this framework, the epis-
temic state of an agent is represented by a formula  . A revi-
sion operator (cid:14) is a function from a formula   and produces a
new formula denoted by   (cid:14) (cid:22). The operator (cid:14) should satisfy
the following postulates.
(R1)   (cid:14) (cid:22) j= (cid:22),
(R2) if   ^ (cid:22) is satis(cid:2)able, then   (cid:14) (cid:22) (cid:17)   ^ (cid:22),

(R3) if (cid:22) is satis(cid:2)able, then   (cid:14) (cid:22) is satis(cid:2)able,
(R4) if  1 (cid:17)  2 and (cid:22)1 (cid:17) (cid:22)2 then  1 (cid:14) (cid:22)1 (cid:17)  2 (cid:14) (cid:22)2,
(R5) (  (cid:14) (cid:22)) ^ ’ j=   (cid:14) ((cid:22) ^ ’),
(R6) if ( (cid:14)(cid:22))^’ is satis(cid:2)able, then  (cid:14)((cid:22)^’) j= ( (cid:14)(cid:22))^’.
An important result is that any revision operator that satis-
(cid:2)es (R1) (cid:0) (R6) is implicitly based a total pre-order (cid:20)  on
(cid:10).

In order to deal with partial pre-orders, Katsuno and
Mendelzon proposed in section 5 of [Katsuno and Mendel-
zon, 1991] to replace (R6) by the two following postulates:
(R7) if   (cid:14) (cid:22)1 j= (cid:22)2 and   (cid:14) (cid:22)2 j= (cid:22)1 then   (cid:14) (cid:22)1 (cid:17)   (cid:14) (cid:22)2,
(R8) (  (cid:14) (cid:22)1) ^ (  (cid:14) (cid:22)2) j=   (cid:14) ((cid:22)1 _ (cid:22)2).

The following representation theorem has been proposed

with these postulates for partial pre-orders.

Theorem 1 ([Katsuno and Mendelzon, 1991]) A
revi-
sion operator (cid:14) satis(cid:2)es the postulates (R1) to (R5),
(R7) and (R8) iff
there exists a faithful assignment
that maps   to a partial pre-order (cid:22)  such that:
M od(  (cid:14) (cid:22)) = M in(M od((cid:22)); (cid:22) ):

Where the faithful assignment is de(cid:2)ned as follows.

De(cid:2)nition 1 (faithful assignment) Let   be a propositional
formula. A partial pre-order on (cid:10), associated with  , de-
noted by (cid:22) , is said to be a faithful assignment if the three
following conditions hold :
(1) if !; !0 2 M od( ) then ! <  !0 does not hold,
(2) if ! 2 M od( ) and ! 0 =2 M od( ), then ! <  !0 holds,
(3) if   (cid:17) ’, then (cid:20) =(cid:20)’.

In the following, by KM postulates, we refer to (R1) (cid:0)

(R5), (R7) and (R8).

3 KM postulates revisited
In the introduction, we pointed out that KM postulates are
not fully satisfactory for iterated belief revision of partially
ordered information. This section justi(cid:2)es this statement and
proposes a revisited set of KM postulates.

3.1 Faithful assignment revisited
This subsection proposes a modi(cid:2)ed de(cid:2)nition of faithful as-
signment. The one given by de(cid:2)nition 1 is not appropriate.
Indeed, if (cid:22)(cid:9) is a partial pre-order on the set of interpreta-
tions (cid:10) representing agent’s epistemic state, and if we de(cid:2)ne
M od(Bel((cid:9))) = M in((cid:10); (cid:22)(cid:9)) to be the current agent’s be-
liefs, then there is no guarantee that (cid:22)(cid:9) will be a faithful
assignment.

For instance, the partial pre-order given by (cid:2)gure 1 is not a
faithful assignment, since condition (2) of De(cid:2)nition 1 is not
satis(cid:2)ed. Indeed M od(Bel((cid:9))) = f!0; !3g and !3 (cid:30)(cid:9) !2
does not hold. Of course, one may simply suggest to enforce
minimal elements of (cid:22)(cid:9) to be equal.
In our example, we
enforce !0 to be equal to !3 (as it is illustrated by Figure 2).

this is not satisfactory.

if (cid:22)(cid:9)0 denotes

ing minimal elements of (cid:22)(cid:9) to be equal

In our ex-
general, Bel((cid:9)0 (cid:14) (cid:22))
if we consider a new piece of information (cid:22)
ample,
it can easily
such that M od((cid:22)) = f!1; !3g,
be checked that Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22))
Indeed
M od(Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22))) = M in(f!1; !3g; (cid:22)(cid:9)) = f!1; !3g and
M od(Bel((cid:9)0 (cid:14) (cid:22))) = M in(f!1; !3g; (cid:22)(cid:9)0) = f!3g,
where (cid:22)(cid:9) and (cid:22)(cid:9)0 are respectively represented by Figure 1
and Figure 2.

6(cid:17) Bel((cid:9)0 (cid:14) (cid:22)).

then,

then,

The problem with De(cid:2)nition 1 is the condition (2), which
requires that each model of agent’s current beliefs is preferred
to all counter-models of agent’s current beliefs. We propose
to weaken this condition by only requiring that each counter-
model of agent’s current beliefs is strictly less preferred than
at least one model of agent’s current beliefs.

In order to deal with iterated belief revision, which applies
to epistemic states instead of formulas, we also modify con-
dition (3) exactly as it is proposed in [Darwiche and Pearl,
1997]. These two changes lead to the following modi(cid:2)ed def-
inition of faithful assignment.

De(cid:2)nition 2 (P-faithful assignment) Let (cid:9) be an epistemic
state. A partial pre-order on (cid:10), associated to (cid:9) and denoted
by (cid:22)(cid:9) is said to be a P-faithful assignment if the three fol-
lowing conditions hold :
(1) if !; !0 j= Bel((cid:9)) then ! (cid:30)(cid:9) !0 does not hold,
(2) if !0

6j= Bel((cid:9)), then there exists ! such that ! j=

Bel((cid:9)) and ! (cid:30)(cid:9) !0,

(3) if (cid:9) = (cid:8), then (cid:22)(cid:9)=(cid:22)(cid:8).

Clearly, if (cid:22)(cid:9) is a faithful assignment, then it is also a P-
faithful assignment. Note that if (cid:22)(cid:9) is a total pre-order, then
this de(cid:2)nition is equivalent to the de(cid:2)nition of a faithful as-
signment of Darwiche and Pearl [Darwiche and Pearl, 1997].

3.2 Revisited postulates for partially ordered

information

Let us now present the (cid:148)revision(cid:148) of KM postulates. In the
whole paper, we assume that the new information (cid:22) is consis-
tent and the initial beliefs M od(Bel((cid:9)) is not empty. Ba-
sically, there is a need of two changes. The (cid:2)rst change
is the same as the one proposed by Darwiche and Pearl in
[Darwiche and Pearl, 1997] (see also [Friedman and Halpern,
1999]). It consists in a simple adaptation of KM postulates
in order to make belief revision operation a function on epis-
temic states instead on set of beliefs. More precisely, we pro-
pose to replace postulate (R4) by the one proposed in [Dar-
wiche and Pearl, 1997].

(P4) if (cid:9)1 = (cid:9)2 and (cid:22)1 (cid:17) (cid:22)2 then Bel((cid:9)1 (cid:14) (cid:22)1) (cid:17)

Bel((cid:9)2 (cid:14) (cid:22)2).

Postulate (P4) requires the equality between epistemic
states while R4 requires the equivalence between beliefs sets.
The second change concerns postulate (R2). We argue that

(R2) is too strong when dealing with partial pre-orders.

Let us consider again the example represented by Fig-
ure 1. Let (cid:22) be such that M od((cid:22)) = f!1; !3g. Since
M in(M od((cid:22)); (cid:22)(cid:9)) = f!1; !3g, we expect to have Bel((cid:9) (cid:14)
(cid:22)) (cid:17) f!1; !3g. But R2 leads to have Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)) (cid:17) f!3g.
Indeed, (R2) says that if Bel((cid:9)) ^ (cid:22) is consistent, then
Bel((cid:9)) (cid:14) (cid:22) (cid:17) Bel((cid:9)) ^ (cid:22). This equivalence makes sense if
for each !; ! 0 models of Bel((cid:9)), ! =(cid:9) !0 holds. However,
when models of Bel((cid:9)) may be incomparable, then (R2) be-
comes questionable.

We suggest to replace R2 by the following postulate. It
concerns the situation where the new piece of information is
a tautology. In this case, agent’s current beliefs should not
change. Namely:
(P2) Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) >) (cid:17) Bel((cid:9)).

3.3 Representation theorem
The new set of postulates that we propose for characteriz-
ing the revision of partially ordered beliefs are the following
ones.
(P1) Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)) j= (cid:22),
(P2) Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) >) (cid:17) Bel((cid:9)),
(P3) if (cid:22) is satis(cid:2)able, then Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)) is satis(cid:2)able,
(P4) if (cid:9)1 = (cid:9)2 and (cid:22)1 (cid:17) (cid:22)2 then Bel((cid:9)1 (cid:14) (cid:22)1) (cid:17)

Bel((cid:9)2 (cid:14) (cid:22)2),

(P5) Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)) ^ ’ j= Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) ((cid:22) ^ ’)),
(P6) if Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)1) j= (cid:22)2 and Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)2) j= (cid:22)1 then

Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)1) (cid:17) Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)2),

(P7) Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)1) ^ Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)2) j= Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) ((cid:22)1 _ (cid:22)2)).

The postulates (P1), (P3), (P4), (P5), correspond respec-
tively to the postulates (R1),(R3), (R4), (R5). The postulates
(P6) and (P7) are respectively a reformalization of the pos-
tulates (R7) and (R8) proposed in [Katsuno and Mendelzon,
1991] for epistemic states.

Two weakenings of (R2) can be derived from this set of

postulates:

(P 0

2) Bel((cid:9)) ^ (cid:22) j= Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)),

(P2w) if Bel((cid:9)) j= (cid:22) then Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)) (cid:17) Bel((cid:9)) ^ (cid:22).

The (cid:2)rst one means that joint of initial beliefs Bel((cid:9)) and
the new information are contained in the set of new belief’s
models. The second one means that if we revise with some
pieces of information that can be inferred from agent’s current
beliefs, then the agent’s beliefs should not change.

Given this set of postulates and the de(cid:2)nition of P-faithful
assignment, we provide the following representation theo-
rem:

Theorem 2 A revision operator (cid:14) satis(cid:2)es the postulates
(P1) to (P7) iff there exists a P-faithful assignment that maps
each (cid:9) to a partial pre-order (cid:22)(cid:9) such that M od(Bel((cid:9) (cid:14)
(cid:22))) = M in(M od((cid:22)); (cid:22)(cid:9)):

4 Characterization of iterated revision

postulates

Several authors (e.g. [Darwiche and Pearl, 1997]) argue that,
in order to have a genuine iterated belief revision operator, we
should augment basic AGM postulates with some additional
postulates. Indeed, these basic postulates constrain the rela-
tionships between Bel((cid:9)) and Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)). The aim of these
additional postulates is to provide more constraints between
(cid:9) and (cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22) by, for instance, expliciting the relationships
between (cid:22)(cid:9) and (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22). Given a formula (cid:22), there are three
questions that need to be addressed:

(cid:15) How the order between models of (cid:22) does evolve?
(cid:15) How the order between counter-models of (cid:22) does

evolve?

(cid:15) How the order between models and counter-models of (cid:22)

does evolve?

Darwiche and Pearl [Darwiche and Pearl, 1997] gave four
natural postulates for iterated belief revision that provide an-
swers for these questions.
(C1) if (cid:11) j= (cid:22), then Bel(((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)) (cid:14) (cid:11)) (cid:17) Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:11)),
(C2) if (cid:11) j= :(cid:22), then Bel(((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)) (cid:14) (cid:11)) (cid:17) Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:11)),
(C3) if Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:11)) j= (cid:22), then Bel(((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)) (cid:14) (cid:11)) j= (cid:22),
(C4) if Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:11)) 6j= :(cid:22), then Bel(((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)) (cid:14) (cid:11)) 6j= :(cid:22).

Another postulate, which has also been discussed in the
literature, is the one which characterizes Boutilier’s natural
belief revision [Boutilier, 1993] (and hinted in [Spohn, 1988])
for totally ordered beliefs:
(CB) If Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)) j= :(cid:11) then Bel(((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)) (cid:14) (cid:11)) (cid:17) Bel((cid:9) (cid:14)

(cid:11)):

This section provides a characterization of the Darwiche
and Pearl’s postulates and the Boutilier’s postulate, when
epistemic states are represented by partial pre-orders.

In the following, we restrict ourselves to iterated belief re-
vision operators that satisfy (P1)(cid:0)(P7). Let (cid:14) be a such revi-
sion operator and (cid:22)(cid:9) be its associated P-faithful assignment.
In order to characterize (C1) (cid:0) (C4) and (CB), we de(cid:2)ne (cid:2)ve
properties on relationships between (cid:22)(cid:9) and (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22).
(Ip1) if ! j= (cid:22) and ! 0 j= (cid:22) then ! (cid:30)(cid:9) !0 iff ! (cid:30)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22) !0;
(Ip2) if ! 6j= (cid:22) and ! 0 6j= (cid:22) then ! (cid:30)(cid:9) !0 iff ! (cid:30)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22) !0;
(Ip3) if ! j= (cid:22) and ! 0 6j= (cid:22) then ! (cid:30)(cid:9) !0 implies ! (cid:30)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22)

!0;

(Ip4) if ! j= (cid:22) and ! 0 6j= (cid:22) then ! (cid:22)(cid:9) !0 implies ! (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22)

!0;

(Ip5) if !; !0 6j= Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)) then ! (cid:30)(cid:9) !0 implies ! (cid:30)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22)

!0:

(Ip1) (resp. (Ip2)) means that the strict order between
models (resp. counter-models) of the new piece of infor-
mation (cid:22) is preserved. (Ip3) means that if a model of (cid:22) is
strictly preferred to a counter-models then this strict prefer-
ence is preserved. (Ip4) is similar with (Ip3) for non-strict
preference. Finally, (Ip5) means that the strict order between
the counter-models of the agent’s current beliefs is preserved.
The following representation theorem provides a charac-

terization of (C1) (cid:0) (C4).

Theorem 3 Let (cid:14) be a revision operator satisfying the postu-
lates (P 1) (cid:0) (P7). Then:
(1) (cid:14) satis(cid:2)es (C1) iff its associated faithful assignment sat-

is(cid:2)es (Ip1),

(2) (cid:14) satis(cid:2)es (C2) iff its associated faithful assignment sat-

is(cid:2)es (Ip2),

(3) (cid:14) satis(cid:2)es (C3) iff its associated faithful assignment sat-

is(cid:2)es (Ip3),

Note that only the characterization of (C3) is identical to
the one provided by Darwiche and Pearl [Darwiche and Pearl,
1997]. The others are different.

More precisely, there are two main differences with the DP

representation theorem. First, we have only
(4) if the faithful assignment associated with (cid:14) satis(cid:2)es

(Ip4) then (cid:14) satis(cid:2)es (C4).

The converse does not hold.
The second main difference concerns (C1) and (C2). In-
deed, Darwiche and Pearl have shown that when (cid:22)(cid:9) is a to-
tal pre-order, then (C1) (resp. (C2)) guarantees that (cid:22)(cid:9) and
(cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22) to be identical on their subdomain M od((cid:22)) (cid:2) M od((cid:22))
(resp. M od(:(cid:22)) (cid:2) M od(:(cid:22))). However, when (cid:22)(cid:9) is a par-
tial pre-order, then only the strict relations (cid:30)(cid:9) and (cid:30)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22) are
identical. Namely, it may happen that ! =(cid:9) !0 and ! (cid:24)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22)
!0 both hold for revision operator satisfying (P1) (cid:0) (P7) and
(C1) (resp. (C2)).

A similar remark also holds for Boutilier’s postulate (CB).

Theorem 4 Let (cid:14) be a revision operator satisfying the postu-
lates (P 1) (cid:0) (P7). Then:

(cid:14) satis(cid:2)es (CB) iff (cid:14) satis(cid:2)es (Ip5).

When (cid:22)(cid:9) is a total pre-order, then (cid:30)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22) is uniquely de-
(cid:2)ned for satisfying (CB). Theorem 4 shows that the unicity
of the result is no longer valid and hence (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22) is not uniquely
de(cid:2)ned. Again, only the strict relation associated with (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22)
is uniquely de(cid:2)ned.

An example of revision operator satisfying (CB) is an ex-

tension to (cid:147)natural revision(cid:148) for partial pre-orders:

De(cid:2)nition 3 Let (cid:9) be an epistemic state and (cid:22) be a proposi-
tional formula, the revised epistemic state (cid:9)(cid:14)n(cid:22) corresponds
to the following partial pre-order:

(cid:15) if !; !0 2 M in(M od((cid:22)); (cid:22)(cid:9)) then ! (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14)n(cid:22) !0 iff

! (cid:22)(cid:9) !0,

(cid:15) if !; !0

! (cid:22)(cid:9) !0,

62 M in(M od((cid:22)); (cid:22)(cid:9)) then ! (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14)n(cid:22) !0 iff

(cid:15) if !

2 M in(M od((cid:22)); (cid:22)(cid:9))
M in(M od((cid:22)); (cid:22)(cid:9)) then ! (cid:30)(cid:9)(cid:14)n(cid:22) !0.

and ! 0

62

The (cid:2)rst condition imposes that the order between the pre-
ferred models of (cid:22) is preserved. The second condition pre-
serves the ordering between non-preferred models of (cid:22). Fi-
nally, the third condition imposes that any minimal models of
(cid:22) is preferred to any other model.

Example 1 Let us consider the epistemic state (cid:9) represented
by Figure 3, where !0 = f:a; :bg, !1 = fa; :bg, !2 =
f:a; bg, !3 = fa; bg. Let (cid:22) be a new piece of information
such that M od((cid:22)) = f!1; !3g. Then the revision of (cid:9) by
the new piece of information (cid:22) is represented by the partial
pre-order (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14)n(cid:22) described by Figure 4.

According to this de(cid:2)nition it can be checked that the revi-
sion operator (cid:14)n provided by de(cid:2)nition 3 satis(cid:2)es the postu-
lates (P1) (cid:0) (P7) and (CB). Moreover, it can be noticed that
(cid:14)n does not satisfy (R2) since M od(Bel((cid:9))) = f!0; !3g,
M od(Bel((cid:9)) (cid:14)n (cid:22)) = f!1; !3g and M od(Bel((cid:9)) ^ (cid:22)) =
f!3g.

5 Two alternative postulates
Among additional postulates (C1) (cid:0) (C4) proposed in [Dar-
wiche and Pearl, 1997] for iterated belief revision, (C1)
seems to be very acceptable. However it is less obvious
with (C2) (for more detailed discussion, see, for instance,
[Lehmann, 1995; Friedman and Halpern, 1999]). Moreover,
(C3) may appear to be too cautious. We now propose to ana-
lyze two alternative postulates which capture two other forms
of iterated belief revision.

The (cid:2)rst one departs from the idea of (C2), and it is
close to the idea of conditioning with a completely sure
information used in uncertainty theories.
In probability
theory (and similarly in possibility theory), if we revise a
probability distribution by some completely sure formula,
then all counter-models of these formulas are considered
as impossible. This properties is captured by the following
postulate.

(Ccond) Bel(((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)) (cid:14) :(cid:22)) (cid:17) :(cid:22).

It expresses that if (cid:9) is revised by (cid:22), and again by its con-
trary :(cid:22), then piece of initial beliefs are ignored, and only
last pieces of information are retained. The characterization
of this postulate is as follows.

Theorem 5 A revision operator (cid:14) satis(cid:2)es the postulates
(P 1) (cid:0) (P7) and (Ccond) iff its corresponding P-faithful as-
signment leads to (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22), which is such that if ! j= :(cid:22) and
!0 j= :(cid:22) then neither ! (cid:30)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22) !0, nor ! 0 (cid:30)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22) ! holds.

We illustrate this postulate by the following de(cid:2)nition of
the extension of qualitative possibilistic revision [Dubois and
Prade, 1992].

De(cid:2)nition 4 Let (cid:9) be an epistemic state such that its cor-
responding P-faithful assignment leads to (cid:22)(cid:9). Let (cid:22) be a
propositional formula, The revised epistemic state (cid:9) (cid:14)(cid:25) (cid:22) is
de(cid:2)ned by:

(cid:15) if !; !0 2 M od((cid:22)) then ! (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:25)(cid:22) !0 iff ! (cid:22)(cid:9) !0,
(cid:15) if !; !0
(cid:15) if ! 2 M od((cid:22)) and ! 0 62 M od((cid:22)) then ! (cid:30)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:25)(cid:22) !0.

62 M od((cid:22)) then ! =(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:25)(cid:22) !0,

Namely, (cid:22)(cid:9) and (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:25)(cid:22) are identical on subdomain
M od((cid:22)) (cid:2) M od((cid:22)). Each models of (cid:22) are preferred to each
counter-models of (cid:22). And lastly, the counter-models of (cid:22) are
considered equally preferred.

Example 2 Let us again consider the epistemic state (cid:9) rep-
resented by Figure 3. Let (cid:22) be a new information such that
M od((cid:22)) = f!1; !3g. Then, the revision of (cid:9) by the new
information (cid:22) is represented by the partial pre-order (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:25)
described by (cid:2)gure 5

!0 =(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:25)(cid:22) !2

!1

!3

Figure 5: (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:25)(cid:22)

According to this de(cid:2)nition it can be checked that the
revision operator (cid:14)(cid:25) provided by de(cid:2)nition 4 satis(cid:2)es the
postulates (P1) (cid:0) (P7), (C1); (C3) (cid:0) (C4) and (Ccond).

The second postulate concerns relationships between
models and counter-models of the new piece of information
(cid:22). The postulate (C3) only requires if some strict preference
in (cid:22)(cid:9) holds, then this preference should also hold in (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22).
We hence propose a stronger version of (C3), called (Clex),
and characterized by:

(Clex) If (cid:11) is not contradictory, (cid:11) j= (cid:22) and (cid:12) j= :(cid:22) then

Bel(((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:22)) (cid:14) ((cid:11) _ (cid:12))) (cid:17) Bel((cid:9) (cid:14) (cid:11)).

Note also that (Clex) implies (C1), by replacing (cid:12) by the

contradiction ?.

Theorem 6 A revision operator (cid:14) satis(cid:2)es the postulates
(P 1) (cid:0) (P7) and (Clex) iff its associated P-faithful assign-
ments leading to (cid:22)(cid:9) and (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22) are such that

(cid:15) if !; !0 j= (cid:22) then ! (cid:30)(cid:9) !0 iff ! (cid:30)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22) !0,
(cid:15) if ! j= (cid:22) and ! 0 6j= (cid:22) then ! (cid:30)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22) !0.

Revision operator (cid:14) satisfying (Clex) constraints each
models to be strictly preferred to all counter-models of the

new piece of information (cid:22). Moreover, it preservers the or-
der between the models of (cid:22). An example of revision opera-
tor satisfying (Clex) is the revision with memory proposed in
[Papini, 2001] and hinted by Spohn [Spohn, 1988] (see also
[Nayak, 1994; Konieczny and Pino P·erez, 2000]).

De(cid:2)nition 5 Let (cid:9) be an epistemic state and (cid:22) be a proposi-
tional formula, the revised epistemic state (cid:9)(cid:14). (cid:22) corresponds
to the following partial pre-order:

(cid:15) if !; !0 2 M od((cid:22)) then ! (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14).(cid:22) !0 iff ! (cid:22)(cid:9) !0,
(cid:15) if !; !0
62 M od((cid:22)) then ! (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14).(cid:22) !0 iff ! (cid:22)(cid:9) !0,
(cid:15) if ! 2 M od((cid:22)) and ! 0 62 M od((cid:22)) then ! (cid:30)(cid:9)(cid:14).(cid:22) !0.

Example 3 Let us again consider the epistemic state (cid:9) rep-
resented by Figure 3. Let (cid:22) be a new information such that
(cid:22) = a. We have M od((cid:22)) = f!1; !3g. Then, the revision
of (cid:9) by the new information (cid:22) is represented by the partial
pre-order (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14). described by (cid:2)gure 6

6 Conclusion
This paper has (cid:2)rst proposed a new de(cid:2)nition of faithful as-
signment suitable for revising partially ordered information.
We then propose a revised version of Katsuno and Mendel-
zon’s postulates. A representation theorem has been proposed
for any revision operator satisfying this new set of postulates.
The paper also proposed a characterization of Darwiche
and Pearl’s postulates and a characterization of Boutilier’s
postulate when information is partially ordered. Two new
postulates with their representation theorem have been pro-
posed for capturing two other forms of belief revision.

When dealing with partial pre-orders, we have shown that
revision operators satisfying iterated revision postulates such
C1 does not allow to guarantee that (cid:22)(cid:9) and (cid:22)(cid:9)(cid:14)(cid:22) to be
identical on some subdomains (for instance on M od((cid:22)) (cid:2)
M od((cid:22)) if C1 is satis(cid:2)ed). A future work will be to inves-
tigate additional postulates that preserve equality on some
subdomains. For instance, it would be interesting to con-
sider a stronger version of P2, by requiring equality between
epistemic states instead of logical equivalence between belief
sets.

Even if results of this paper are oriented belief revision,
it can be interesting to discuss this work in the framework
of updating [Katsuno and Mendelzon, 1992] (since updating
has also questioned (R2), even if representation theorems are
clearly different).

Another future work is to extend results to this paper to
the revision of a partial pre-order by a partial pre-order and
extends, for instance, postulate proposed in [Benferhat et al.,
2000].
