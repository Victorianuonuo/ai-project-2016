of  detecting  a  pattern  distinguished  by  a  small 
luminance,  AI,  superimposed  on  a  uniform  background 
of  luminance  I,  this  detector  can  do  no  better 
than  count  the  photons  arriving  within  the  area 
where  the  pattern  is  anticipated,  and  compare  this 
with  the  mean  density  of  arrival  of  photons  in  the 
background  I. 
Background  photons  are  considered 
indistinguishable  from  target  photons,  and  a ll 
these  incident  photons  are  given  equal  weight  in 
the  output  of  the  device  ( i . e .,  it  is  linear),  so

into  account  in  the  final  decision.
