Abstract

Protein fold recognition is a crucial step in infer-
ring biological structure and function. This paper
focuses on machine learning methods for predict-
ing quaternary structural folds, which consist of
multiple protein chains that form chemical bonds
among side chains to reach a structurally stable
domain. The complexity associated with model-
ing the quaternary fold poses major theoretical and
computational challenges to current machine learn-
ing methods. We propose methods to address these
challenges and show how (1) domain knowledge
is encoded and utilized to characterize structural
properties using segmentation conditional graph-
ical models; and (2) model complexity is han-
dled through efﬁcient inference algorithms. Our
model follows a discriminative approach so that
any informative features, such as those representa-
tive of overlapping or long-range interactions, can
be used conveniently. The model is applied to pre-
dict two important quaternary folds, the triple β-
spirals and double-barrel trimers. Cross-family val-
idation shows that our method outperforms other
state-of-the art algorithms.

1 Introduction

Proteins, as chains of amino acids, tend to adopt unique three-
dimensional structures in their native environments. These
structures play key roles in determining the activities and
functions of the proteins. An important issue in computation-
ally inferring the three-dimensional structures from amino-
acid sequences is protein fold recognition and alignment.
Given a target protein fold 1 , the task seeks to predict whether
a test protein sequence adopts the fold and if so, provides its
sequence-to-topology alignment against the fold.

There are different kinds of protein folds based on their
structural properties. In this paper, we focus on the most com-
plex ones, namely quaternary structural folds, which consist
of multiple protein chains that form chemical bonds among

1Protein folds are typical spatial arrangements of well-deﬁned

secondary structures which appear repeatedly in different proteins

the side chains of sequence-distant residues to reach a struc-
turally stable domain. These folds commonly exist in many
proteins and contribute signiﬁcantly to evolutionary stability.
Some examples include enzymes, hemoglobin, ion channels
as well as viral adhesive and viral capsids.

To date, there has been signiﬁcant progress in protein ter-
tiary fold (single chain topology) recognition, ranging from
sequence similarity matching [Altschul et al., 1997; Durbin
et al., 1998], to threading algorithms based on physical forces
[Jones et al., 1992] and to machine learning methods [Cheng
and Baldi, 2006; Ding and Dubchak, 2001]. However, there
are three major challenges in protein sequence-to-structure
mapping that hinder previous work from being applied to
the quaternary fold recognition: (1) many proteins adopt the
same structural fold without apparent sequence similarities.
This property violates the basic assumption of many machine
learning algorithms that similar observations tend to share
the same labels; (2) amino acids distant in sequence-order
(the distance is not known a priori) or on different chains
may form chemical bonds in the three-dimensional structures.
Most of these bonds are essential in the stability of the struc-
tures and have to be considered for accurate prediction; (3)
furthermore, previous methods for predicting folds with sin-
gle chains are not directly applicable because the complex-
ity is greatly increased both biologically and computationally,
when moving to quaternary multi-chain structures.

From a machine learning perspective, protein fold recog-
nition falls in the general problem of predicting structured
outputs, which learns a mapping between input variables
and structured, interdependent output variables. Conditional
graphical models, such as conditional random ﬁelds (CRF)
[Lafferty et al., 2001], max-margin Markov networks [Taskar
et al., 2003], and semi-Markov CRF [Sarawagi and Cohen,
2004], have demonstrated successes in multiple applications.
To address the challenges in protein fold recognition, we de-
velop a new segmentation conditional graphical model. As
an extension of the CRF model, it deﬁnes the hidden nodes
as labels assigned to segments (subsequences corresponding
to one secondary structure element) rather than to individ-
ual amino acid, then connects two nodes with edges to hy-
pothesize chemical bonds. The conditional probability of the
hidden variables (i.e. the segmentation of each structure ele-
ment) given the observed sequence is deﬁned as an exponen-
tial form of the features. In addition, efﬁcient approximation

algorithms are examined to ﬁnd optimal or near-optimal so-
lutions. Compared with previous work in CRF, our model is
novel in capturing the long-range dependencies of different
subunits within one chain and between chains.

The major advantages of our approach for protein fold
recognition include: (1) the ability to encode the output struc-
tures (both inter-chain and intra-chain chemical bonding) us-
ing the graph; (2) dependencies between segments can be
non-Markovian so that the chemical-bonding between distant
amino acids can be captured; (3) it permits the convenient
use of any features that measure the property of segments the
biologists have identiﬁed.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 introduces the basic concepts of protein structures and
fold recognition; section 3 describes the details of our model,
followed by a discussion of efﬁcient inference algorithms for
training and testing. In section 5, we give two examples of
the quaternary folds and show our successful experimental re-
sults. The paper concludes with suggestions for future work.

2 Protein Structure Basics and Fold

Recognition

To study protein structures, biologists have deﬁned four con-
ceptual hierarchies based on current understanding: the pri-
mary structure simply refers to the linear chain of amino
acids; the secondary structure can be thought of as the lo-
cal conformation of protein chains, or intuitively as building
blocks for its global 3D structures. There are three types of
standard secondary structures in nature, i.e. α-helix, a rod-
shape peptide chain coiled to form a helix structure, β-sheets,
two or more peptide strands aligned in the same direction
(parallel β-sheet) or opposite direction (antiparallel β-sheet)
and stabilized by hydrogen bonds. These two types of sec-
ondary structures are connected by the remaining irregular
regions, referred to as coil. The tertiary structure is the global
three-dimensional structures of a single protein chain. Some-
times multiple chains are associated with each other and form
a uniﬁed structure, i.e. the quaternary structures.

Protein folds are identiﬁable spatial arrangements of sec-
ondary structures. It is observed that there exist only a lim-
ited number of topologically distinct folds in nature (around
1,000) although we have discovered millions of protein se-
quences. As a result, proteins with the same fold often do
not demonstrate sequence similarities, which might reveal
important information about structural or functional conser-
vation due to common ancestors. An example is the triple β-
spiral fold, a processive homotrimer which serves as a ﬁbrous
connector from the main virus capsid to a C-terminal knob
that binds to host cell-surface receptor proteins. The fold
has been identiﬁed to commonly exist in adenovirus (a DNA
virus which infects both humans and animals), reovirus (an
RNA virus which infects human) and bacteriophage PRD1
(a DNA virus infecting bacteria), however, the similarity be-
tween these protein sequences are very low (below 25% sim-
ilarity). Identifying more examples of the triple β-spiral fold
will not only help the biologists to establish that it is a com-
mon fold in nature, but also reveal important evolutionary re-
lationships between the viral proteins.

The example above motivates the task of accurate protein
fold recognition and alignment prediction. The problem set-
ting is as follows: given a target protein fold, as well as
a set of N training sequences x
including
both positive and negative examples with structural annota-
tion, i.e. 3-D coordinates of each atom in the proteins, predict
(without structural annota-
whether a new test sequence x
tion) adopts the fold or not, and if yes, identify its speciﬁc
location in the sequence.

3 Representation of Domain Knowledge

It can be seen that the fold recognition task is a typical seg-
mentation and labeling problem except that we need to ad-
dress the following questions to represent the domain knowl-
edge: how to (1) represent the states and (2) capture the struc-
tural information within the observed sequences?

The chemical bonding physically exists at the atomic level
on the side-chains of amino acids, however, the structural
topology and interaction maps are conserved only at the sec-
ondary structure level due to the many possible insertions or
deletions in the protein sequence. Therefore it is natural for
the state labels to be assigned to segments (subsequences cor-
responding to one secondary structure element) rather than
to individual amino acids, and then connect nodes with edges
indicating their dependencies in three-dimensional structures.
Next, we deﬁne the formal representation of the structure in-
formation in the protein fold and discuss how to incorporate
domain-knowledge features to help the prediction.

(cid:2)

3.1 Protein Structure Graph (PSG)
An undirected graph G =< V, E >, called protein struc-
ture graph (PSG), can be deﬁned for the target protein fold,
where V = U
{I}, U is the set of nodes corresponding
to the secondary structure elements within the fold and I is
the node to represent the elements outside the fold. E is the
set of edges between neighboring elements in sequence or-
der (i.e. the polypeptide bonding) or edges indicating long-
range dependencies between elements in three-dimensional
structures (i.e. chemical bonding, such as hydrogen bonds or
disulﬁde bonds). Figure 1 shows an example of the simple β-
α-β motif. Notice that there is a clear distinction between the
edges colored in red and those in black in terms of probabilis-
tic semantics: similar to a chain-structured CRF, the black
edges indicate state transitions between adjacent nodes; the
red edges are used to model long-range interactions, which
are unique to the protein structure graph. The PSG for a qua-
ternary fold can be derived similarly: ﬁrst construct a PSG
for each component protein or a component monomeric PSG
for homo-multimers, and then add edges between the nodes
from different chains if there are chemical bonds, forming a
more complex but similarly-structured quaternary PSG.

Given the deﬁnition of the protein structure graph, our next
question is how to automatically build the graph for a partic-
ular fold. The answer depends on the type of protein folds
of concern and how much knowledge we can bring to bear.
For folds that biologists have studied over the years and ac-
cumulated some basic knowledge of their properties (for ex-
ample β-α-β motif or β-helix), the topology of this graph

can be constructed easily by communicating with the experts.
If it is a fold whose structure is totally unknown to biolo-
gists, we can follow a general procedure with the following
steps: ﬁrst, construct a multiple structure alignment of all the
positive proteins (among themselves); second, segment the
alignment into disjoint parts based on the secondary struc-
tures of the majority proteins; third, draw a graph with nodes
denoting the resulting secondary structure elements and then
add edges between neighboring nodes. Finally, add the long-
range interaction edge between two nodes if the average dis-
tance between all the involved residues is below the threshold
required for side-chain hydrogen-bonding. We skip the de-
tails of the latter case as it is a separate line of research and
assume that we are given a reasonably good graph over which
we perform our learning, since this is the focus of the paper.

3.2 Segmentation Conditional Graphical Models

(SCGM)

Given a structure graph G deﬁned on one chain and a protein
sequence x = x1x2 . . . xN , we can have a possible segmen-
tation label of the sequence, i.e. y = {M, w}, where M is
the number of segments and wj = {sj, pj, qj}, in which sj,
pj, and dj are the state, starting position and ending position
of the jth
segment. Following the idea of CRF, the condi-
tional probability of a segmentation y given the observation
x is deﬁned as follows:

seg-
ment. Following the same deﬁnition as above, we decompose
the potential function over the cliques as a product of unary

where fk and gk are node-features and pair features respec-
tively, θ1,k and θ2,k are the corresponding weights, and Z is
the normalizer over possible segmentation conﬁgurations of
all the sequences jointly (see Figure 2 for its graphical model
representation). Notice that joint inference is required since
the quaternary fold is stabilized by the chemical bonding be-
tween all component proteins and that is the key computa-
tional challenge.

3.3 Feature Extraction
The SCGM model provides an expressive framework to han-
dle the structural properties for protein fold recognition.
However, the choice of feature functions fk and gk play
a key role in accurate predictions. Following the feature
deﬁnition in the CRF model, we factor the features as fol-
lows: fk(xi, wi,j ) = f (cid:5)
k(xi, pi,j, qi,j) if si,j = s and qi,j −
pi,j ∈ length range(s), 0 otherwise. gk(xa, xb, wa,u, wb,v) =
g(cid:5)

0 otherwise.

k. The node feature f (cid:5)

Next we discuss how to deﬁne the segment-based features
f (cid:5)
k and g(cid:5)
k covers the properties of an
individual segment, for example, “whether a speciﬁc motif
appears in the subsequence”, “averaged hydrophobicity”, or
“the length of the segment”. The pairwise feature g(cid:5)
k cap-
tures the dependencies between segments whose correspond-
ing subsequences form chemical bonds in the 3-D structures.
For example, previous work in structural biology suggests
different propensities to form the bonds between the amino
acids pairs. Therefore the pairwise features could be the
propensity scores of the two subsequences to form hydrogen
bonds. Notice that the feature deﬁnitions can be quite gen-
eral, not limited to the examples above. The discriminative
setting of the model enables us to use any kinds of informa-
tive features without additional costs.

4 Efﬁcient Inference
To ﬁnd the best conformation of test sequences, we need to
consider the labels of all the protein chains jointly since every
chain contributes to the stability of the structures. Given the
enormous search spaces in quaternary folds, we need to ﬁnd
efﬁcient inference and learning algorithms.

4.1 Training Phase
The feature weights {θ1,k} and {θ2,k} are the model parame-
ters. In the training phase, we estimate their values by maxi-

Since PSGs may be complex graphs with loops and multi-
ple chains (with an average degree of 3-4 for each node), we
explored efﬁcient approximation methods to estimate the fea-
ture expectation. There are three major approximation ap-
proaches in graphical models: sampling, variational methods
and loopy belief propagation. Sampling techniques have been
widely used in the statistics community, however, there is
a problem if we use the naive Gibbs sampling. Notice that
in each sampling iteration the dimension of hidden variables
yi varies in cases where the number of segments of Mi is
also a variable (e.g. unknown number of structural repeats
in the folds). Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo
(reversible jump MCMC) algorithms have been proposed to
solve the problem and demonstrated success in various ap-
plications, such as mixture models [Green, 1995] and hidden
Markov model for DNA sequence segmentation [Boys and
Henderson, 2001].

Given a segmentation yi = (Mi, wi), our goal is propose

D(v) = D(y∗

In general, many protein folds have regular arrangements
of the secondary structure elements so that the state tran-
sitions are deterministic or almost deterministic. Therefore
the operator for state transition can be removed and seg-
ment split or merge can be greatly simpliﬁed. There might
be cases where the inter-chain or intra-chain interactions are
also stochastic. Then two additional operators are necessary,
including segment join (adding an interaction edge in the pro-
tein structure graph) and segment separate (deleting an in-
teraction edge in the graph). The details are similar to state
transition, and we omit the discussion due to limited space.

4.2 Testing Phase
Given a test example with multiple chains {x1, . . . , xC }, we
need to search the segmentation that yields the highest con-
ditional likelihood. Similar to the training phase, it is an
optimization problem involving search in multi-dimensional
space. Since it is computationally prohibitive to search over
all possible solutions using traditional optimization meth-
ods, simulated annealing with reversible jump MCMC is
used.
It has been shown theoretically and empirically to
converge onto the global optimum [Andrieu et al., 2000].
ALGORITHM-1 shows the detailed description of reversible
jump MCMC simulated annealing. β is a parameter to con-
trol the temperature reduction rate, which is set to 0.5 in our
experiments for rapid convergence.

5 Experiments

To demonstrate the effectiveness of different recognition
models, we choose two protein folds as examples, includ-
ing the triple β-spiral [van Raaij et al., 1999], a virus ﬁber,
and the double-barrel trimer [Benson et al., 2004], which is a
building block for the virus capsid hexons. We choose these
two folds speciﬁcally because they are both involved in im-
portant biological functions and shared by viruses from dif-
ferent species, which might reveal important evolution rela-
tionships in the viral proteins. Moreover, TBS should ﬁt our

Notice that our model may be used for any protein folds,

complex and challenging protein folds.

5.1 Protein Structure Graph of Target Fold

Triple β-spiral fold (TBS)
is a processive homotrimer con-
sisting of three identical interacting protein chains (see Figure
3). It provides the structural stability for the adhesion protein
to initiate a viral attack upon the target cell wall. Up to now
there are three proteins of this fold with resolved structures.
However, its common existence in viruses of different species
reveals important evolutionary relationships. It also indicates
that TBS might be a common fold in nature although very
few examples have been identiﬁed so far.

To provide a better prediction model, we notice the follow-
ing structural characteristics in TBS: it consists of three iden-
tical protein chains with a varied number of repeated struc-
tural subunits. Each subunit is composed of: (1) a β-strand
that runs parallel to the ﬁber axis; (2) a long solvent-exposed
loop of variable lengths; (3) a second β-strand that forms an-
tiparallel β-sheets with the ﬁrst one, and slightly skewed to
the ﬁber axis; (4) successive structural elements along the
same chain are connected together by tight β-turns [Weigele
et al., 2003]. Among these four components, the two β-
strands are quite conserved in sequences and van Raaij et al.
characterize them by labeling each position using character
[van Raaij et al., 1999]. Speciﬁcally, i-o for the
‘a’ to ‘o’
ﬁrst strand and a-h for the second strand (see Figure 3-(Top-
right)). Based on the discussion above, we deﬁne the PSG
for the TBS fold in Figure 3. There are 5 states altogether,
i.e. B1, T1, B2 and T2, which correspond to the four com-
ponents of each repeated structural subunits respectively, and
the null state I, which refers to the non-triple β-spiral region.
We ﬁx the length of B1 and B2 as 7 and 8 respectively due
to their sequence conservation; in addition, we set the length
of T1 and T2 in [0, 15] and [0, 8] individually since longer
insertions will bring instability to the structures (this is an ex-
ample of prior biological knowledge constraining the model
space). The pairs of interacting residues are marked on the
edges, which are used to deﬁne the pairwise features.

to uncover the structural conservation through sequences ho-
mology since there are only four positive proteins and the se-
quence similarity is low.

The DBT fold consists of two eight-stranded jelly rolls, or
β-barrels (see Figure 4). The eight component β-strands are
labeled as B, C, D, E, F, G, H and I respectively. Some general
descriptive observations include: (1) the lengths of the eight
β-strands vary, ranging from 4 to 16 residues, although the
layout of the strands is ﬁxed. The loops (insertions) between
the strands are in general short (4 - 10 residues), however,
there are some exceptions, for example the long insertions
between the F and G strand (20 - 202 residues); further long
loops between D-E strand (9 - 250 residues); and the short β-
turn between E and F. (2) The chemical bonds that stabilize
the trimers are located between the FG loops. Unfortunately,
the speciﬁc location and bonding type remain unclear. We de-
note the FG loop in the ﬁrst double-barrel trimer as FG1, and
that in the second one as FG2. Based on the discussion above,
we deﬁne the PSG of the double-barrel trimer as shown in

tive sequences most similar to the positive ones. The node
features include template matching and HMM proﬁle score
for B1 and B2 motifs (for TBS fold), averaged secondary
structure prediction score, hydrophobicity, solvent accessi-
bility and ionizable scores. The pairwise features include
side-chain alignment score as well as parallel/anti-parallel β-
sheet alignment score. We compare our results with standard
sequence similarity-based algorithm PSI-BLAST [Altschul
et al., 1997], proﬁle hidden-Markov model methods, Pfam
[Bateman et al., 2004] and HMMER [Durbin et al., 1998]
with structural alignment, as well as free-energy based al-
[Jones et al., 1992]. For our model, the
gorithm Threader
number of iterations in simulated annealing is set to 500. It
may not provide the globally optimal solutions, but the sub-
optimal ones we get seem to be very reasonable as shown
below. The rank is sorted based on the log ratio of the prob-
ability of the best segmentation to that of degrading into one
segment with null state.

We can see all the methods except the SCGM model per-
form poorly for predicting the TBS fold (Table 1). With PSI-
BLAST, we can only get hits for the reovirus when search-
ing against adenovirus, and vice versa. Neither can be found
when we use the PRD1 as the query. The task of identifying
the TBS fold is very difﬁcult since it involves complex struc-
tures, yet there are only three positive examples. However,
our methods not only can score all the known triple β-spirals
higher than the negative sequences, but also is able to recover

5.2 Experiment Results
In the experiments, we test our hypothesis by examining
whether our model can score the known positive examples
higher than the negative ones by using the positive sequences
from different protein families in the training set. Following
the setup described in [Liu et al., 2005], we construct a PDB-
minus dataset as negative examples (2810 proteins in total),
which consists of all non-homologous proteins with known
structures and conﬁrmed not having the TBS (or DBT) fold.
A leave-family-out cross-validation was performed (with-
holding all the positive proteins from the same family) 2. Sim-
ilarly, the PDB-minus set was also randomly partitioned into
three subsets, one of which is placed in the test set while the
rest serve as the negative training examples. Since negative
data dominate the training set, we subsample only 10 nega-

2Cross-family prediction is both more useful and more challeng-
ing than within family structure prediction since the latter can rely
on sequence homology while the former typically cannot.

most of the repeats from the segmentation (Figure 5). The
next step is to predict the presence of the TBS fold on pro-
teins with unresolved structures, leading to targeted crystal-
lography experiments for validation.

From Table 2, we can see that it is an extremely difﬁcult
task to predict the DBT fold. Our method is able to give
higher ranks for 3 of the 4 known DBT proteins, although
we are unable to reach a clear separation between the DBT
proteins and the rest. The results are within our expectation
because the lack of signal features and unclear understand-
ing about the inter-chain interactions makes the prediction
signiﬁcantly harder. We believe more improvement can be
achieved by combining the results from multiple algorithms.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a new and effective learning
model, the segmentation conditional graphical model, for
protein quaternary fold recognition. A protein structure graph
is deﬁned to capture the structural properties. Following a
discriminative approach, our model permits the use of any
types of features, such as overlapping or long-range interac-
tion features. Due to the complexity of the graph, reversible
jump MCMC is used for inference and optimization. Our
model is applied to predict the triple β-spiral and double-
barrel trimer fold with promising results. Furthermore, since
the long-range dependencies are common in many other ap-
plications, such as machine translation, we anticipate that our
approach can be productively extended for other tasks.
