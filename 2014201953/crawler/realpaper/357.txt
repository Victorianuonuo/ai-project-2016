Abstract 

The  extraction  of  the  line  drawing 
of  3-dimensional  objects  presented  here 
is  developed  for  the  eye  of  the  i n t e l l i(cid:173)
gent  robot  studied  in  the  Electro-
technical  Laboratory.  This  procedure 
consists  mainly  of  two  processes.  First, 
four  line  drawings  of  the  same  objects 
illuminated  from  four  different  d i(cid:173)
rections  are  sequentially  obtained. 
Second,  by  applying  2-dimensional  logical 
operations  to  these  line  drawings,  a 
complete  one  is  extracted.  This  method 
is  applicable  to  more  then  two  poly(cid:173)
hedrons  in  a  scene  which  is  d i f f i c u lt  by 
usual  methods  heretofore  presented 
because  of  too  small  difference  of  light 
intensities  between  two  different  planes 
or  the  effects  of  shadows. 

1. 

In troduc tion 

The  recognition  of  3-dimonsional 

objects  is  necessary  for  intelligent 
robots  that  manipulate  objects  in  re(cid:173)
lation  to  visual  information.  Up  to  now 
the  recognition  of  a  simple  polyhedron 
based  on  i ts  line  drawing  has  been  studied 
by  lighting  it  so  that  the  effect  of 
shadow  is  eliminated.(1),  (2)  The  ex(cid:173)
traction  of  a  complete  line  drawing  i s, 
however,  very  d i f f i c u lt  because  of  too 
small  differences  of  light  intensities 
between  two  different  planes  or  the 

effects  of  shadows.  The  improved  method 
presented  here  for  extracting  the  line 
drawing  consists  of  two  steps.  First,  by 
lighting  the  objects  from  several  d i(cid:173)
rections  sequentially,  the  line  drawing 
for  each  illumination  is  extracted. 
Next,  only  useful  information  is  ex(cid:173)
tracted  from  the  obtained  line  drawings. 
This  method  has  been  developed  for  the 
eye  of  the  intelligent  robot  studied  in 
the  Electrotechnical  Laboratory.

The  outline  of  the  whole  procedure 
is  shown  in  F i g . l.  Each  block  in  Fig.l 
is  described  in  the  following  sections. 

2.  Data  input 

A  vidicon  TV  camera  is  used  as  the 

visual  input  device.  A  preprocessor 
(Fig.2)  is  employed  to  transfer  the  video 
signal  to  a  computer.  This  preprocessor 
divides  a  picture  frame  into  256  x  256 
picture  elements  and  digitizes  the  video 
signal  of  64  x  64  elements  to  6  bits  (64 
levels  of  light  intensity)  in  one 
scanning  period.  The  region  of  a  picture 
frame  to  be  sampled  is  controlled  by  a 
c omputer. 

3.  Extraction  of  a  line  drawing 

illuminated  from  one  direction 
The  procedure  to  obtain  a  line 

drawing,  which  is  represented  by  a  set  of 
equations  of  lines,  consists  of  (1) 
smoothing,  (2)  spatial  differentiation, 
(3)  f i l t e r i ng  1,  (A)  thinning,  (5) 
f i l t e r i ng  2,  (6)  tracking  and  (7)  line 
f i t t i n g.  Each  stage  is  described  below. 

(1)  Smoothing 

This  stage  is  to  eliminate  the  noise 

of  the  vitlicon  camera  and  the  prepro(cid:173)
cessor,  by  applying  a  3  x  3  nonlinear 
f i l t er  to  the  picture  elements.  Let  the 
element  of  the  3 x3  matrix  be  denoted  as 
in  Fig.3  and  the  value  of  the  picture

smoothing  operation  eliminates  the 
change  of  brightness  caused  by  noise,  but 
preserves  the  resolution  of  the  picture 
which  is  lost  by  the  usual  smoothing 
methods. 

(3)  Filtering  1 

If  a  picture  includes  an  edge,  the 
picture  elements  with  large  1)  constitute 
a  line  whose  width  is  larger  than  2 
elements.  Based  on  this  fact,  the  noise 
is  eliminated  by  the  3 x3  f i l t e r.  Let 
D(i)  denote  the  value  D  of  the  C(i), 
f i l t er  1  corrects  D(o)  to  0  if  among  i ts 
adjacent  I)( i ) (i =1 , . . . , 8 ) ,  more  than  five 
D(I)  take  value  0. 

(A)  Thinni ng 

The  edges  of  the  objects  are  detect(cid:173)
ed  by  f i l t e r i ng  1  such  that  the  D  of  each 
element  distributes  like  a  ridge  whose 
center  corresponds  to  an  edge.  The 
thinning  is  to  detect  the  peak  of  the  D 
and  correct  the  other  D  to  0.  The 
algorithm  is  to  detect  the  segment  of  the 
]ine  formed  by  the  picture  elements  and 
to  examine  sequentially  the  adjacent 
element  toward  its  perpendicular  direction 
to  determine  whether  or  not  the  D  of  the 
element  is  to  be  corrected.  For  a 
detailed  description,  the  definitions  are 
given  in  the  following: 
a)  The  direction  perpendicular  to  K  is 

dentoed  by  L. 

b)  Two  elements  which  are  adjacent  to  an 
element  in  the  direction  L  are  denoted 

respectively,  and  those 

which  are  adjacent  in  the  direction  K 
are  denoted  by  k  and  k'. 

c)  Let  K(i)  denote  the  value  K  of  the 

element  i;  the  element  0  is  the  line 
segment  with  error  d  if  and  only  if  the 
following  two  conditions  are  satisfied.

Session No.  3  Scene Analysis II General Papers 

The  philosophy  of  synthesis  of  the 
desired  line  drawing  is  to  extract  the 
useful  information  from  4  line  drawings 
which  are  obtained  by  lighting  the 
objects  from  different  directions.  Let  A, 
B  and  C  denote  the  line  drawings  obtained 
by  lighting  from  different  directions,  if 
the  position  of  the  shadow  in  A  is 
different  from  that  in  B,  the  result  of 
A.B  includes  no  lines  caused  by  the 
effect  of  the  shadow.  Although  each  A,  B 
or  C  alone  may  not  include  edges  whose 
adjacent  planes  have  the  same  light 
intensities,  every  edge  is  included  in 
either  A,  B  or  C.  Therefore,  the  result 
of  (A+B+C)  includes  every  edge.  On  the 
other  hand,  if  the  objects  are  lighted 
from  the  frontal  direction,  the  obtained 
line  drawing  1)  is  free  from  the  effect  of 
the  shadow.  Thus,  the  operation  sequence 
to  synthesize  the  desired  line  drawing  E 
from  I)  and  the  other  3  line  drawings  ob(cid:173)
tained  by  lighting  from  different  d i(cid:173)
rection  A,  B  and  C  consists  of  the  next 
6  steps. 

The  result  of  this  sequence  using  A(Fig.8) 
,  B(Fig.9),  C(Fig.l2)  and  i)(Fig.l3)  is 
illustrated  in  Fig.14. 

The  block  "Set  the  lighting"  in  Fig.1 

i s,  therefore,  to  get  the  line  drawings 
A,  B,  C  and  D,  and  the  block  "Indicate 
the  logical  operation"  is  to  perform  the 
above  described  sequence. 

5.  The  procedure  of  the  2-dimensional 

logical  operations 

There  are  mainly  two  methods  for  the 

previously  defined  logical  operations 
such  as  the  one  at  the  line  drawing  level 
and  at  the  intensity  array  level.  For 
simplicity  of  the  procedure,  the  latter 

method  is  adopted  here. 

The  procedure  of  the  logical  oper(cid:173)
ations  previously  defined  is  as  follows. 
First,  the  line  drawing  is  mapped  to  the 
array  of  the  differentiation.  The 
element  of  the  array  that  corresponds  to 
a  line  segment  of  the  line  drawing  is 
given  value  D]  and  the  direction  of  the 
line  L,  and  the  adjacent  element  is  given 
D2 (D2<D1)  and  L.  The  result  of  this 
operation  is  just  the  same  as  obtained  in 
spatial  differentiation  described  in  3  -
(2),  except  that  it  includes  no  noise. 
The  operation  OR  of  A  and  B  utilizes  the 
two  arrays  thus  mapped  from  A  and  B, 
respectively,  to  make  a  new  array  by 
adding  the  two  arrays.  Then,  by  applying 
the  previously  described  thinning, 
tracking  and  line  f i t t i ng  to  the  new 
array,  the  result  of  OR  is  obtained.  The 
operation  AND  is  just  the  same  as  OR 
except  that  the  new  array  is  made  such 
that  if  1)=0  at  one  of  the  corresponding 
elements  of  two  arrays,  then  the  value  of 
the  corresponding  new  element  is  0.  Thus 
these  operations  regard  the  two  lines,  in 
A  and  B,  as  the  same  edge  even  if  their 
positions  are  slightly  different  from 
each  other.  This  method  is  very  simple 
because  only  new  algorithm  to  be  de(cid:173)
veloped  is  to  map  the  line  drawings  to 
the  array  of  differentiation.  The  other 
algorithm  such  as  thinning,  tracking  and 
line  f i t t i ng  are  just  the  same  as 
described  in  section  3. 

6.  Cone 1 us ions 

The  extraction  of  the  line  drawing 

by  sequential  lighting  from  several 
directions  is  proved  to  be  applicable  to 
a  scene  where  objects  are  placed  behind 
other  objects.  The  desired  line  drawing 
of  a  few  types  of  prisms  and  pyramids  are 
obtained  by  lighting  from  the  l e f t,

right,  up  and  front  sequentially.  The 
calculation  time  is  about  10  times  as 
long  as  that  of  obtaining  a  lino  drawing 
illuminated  from  one  direction.  Though 
it  takes  at  present  about  2  minutes  by 
NEAC-3100  (cycle  time  is 
memory),  a  large  part  of  the  calculation 
can  be  processed  by  special  purpose 
hardware.  Application  to  more  compli(cid:173)
cated  objects  may  be  possible  if  the 
present  resolution  of  a  picture  (64  x  64) 
is  improved.
