Other  Work 

The  work  of  Rosenblatt2  and  other  workers 

the  Perceptron  f i e ld  have  considered  arrays  of 
neural-nets 
for  pattern  recognition.  However, 
they  are  considering  randomly  connected  arrays 
which  have  learning  properties. 

in 

Similary  work  has  been  done  in  feature 

detectors  by  Babcock  et  a l3.  They  have  considered 
l o g i c al  one  and  two  dimensional  arrays  of  neuron-. 
l i ke  c e l ls  and  l o g i c al  functions 
for  these  c e l ls 
such  as  exclusive  OR  c i r c u i ts  which  provide  edge 
detection.  Other  studies  carried  out  by  Babcock, 
including  d i f f e r e n t i al  geometry  and 
calculus,  have  provided  a  preface  to  some  of  the 
work  that 

is  reported  here.
