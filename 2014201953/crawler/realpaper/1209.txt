Summary 

This  paper  analyzes  an  optimal  data  c o l(cid:173)
lection  and  processing  system  for  detecting  a 
random  signal  field  in  a  random  noise  field 
employing  multiple  antennas.  The  statistical 
model  consists  of  a  Gaussian  random  signal 
field  and  an  independent  Gaussian  noise  field. 
The  time  optimal  data  processing  system  to  be 
analyzed  is  specified  in  terms  of  array  deploy(cid:173)
ment  and  signal/noise  space  time  correlation 
structure.  An  exact  expression  for  the  charac(cid:173)
teristic  function  of  the  test  statistic  computed 
by  the  space-time  signal  processor  is  derived 
under  the  assumptions  of  stationarity  and  a  long 
observation  time.  Analytical  difficulties 
involved  in  evaluating  and  inverse  transforming 
the  characteristic  function  are  considered through 
case  studies.  The  test  statistic  is  analytically 
shown  to reduce  to  a  Gaussian  random  variable 
in  the  threshold  case  for  the  array  situation.  The 
dependence  of  receiver  performance  on  the  space-
time  correlation  structure  of  the  signal  and  noise 
fields,  the  antenna  deployment,  and  the  optimal 
performance  criteria  (outage  rate,  pre-detection 
signal-to-noise  ratio,  etc.)  is  considered.  Opti(cid:173)
mal  antenna  deployment  is  considered,  for  the 
threshold  case,  in  terms  of  several  physically 
realistic  signal  and  noise  field  space-time  corre(cid:173)

Introduction 

The  problem  of  detecting  a  random  signal 
field  in  the  presence  of  a  random  noise  field  has 
received  various  treatments  in  the  literature. 
Despite  certain  limited  analytical  treatment  this 
is  an  important  problem  that  occurs  in  many 
areas,  such  as  fading  on  long  range  communica(cid:173)
tion  and  radar  links,  sonar,  radio  astronomy, 
etc.  The  treatment  addressed  to  this  problem 
thus  far  consists  almost  exclusively  of  the  deri(cid:173)
vation  of  the  optimal  receiver  structure.  The 
early  work  was  done  for  the  scalar  (one  antenna) 
case  by  Price*  who  only  considered  white  noise 
and  Middleton2/3  who  considered  colored  noise. 
In  these  cases  the  derivations  were  performed

Joint  Services  Electronics  Program  under  Grant

using  sampling  point  analysis  rather  than  the 
more  rigorous  and  useful  Karhunen-Loeve  expan(cid:173)
sion4  approach  employed  herein.  Middleton2,3 
also  considered  system  performance  with  results 
presented  in  sampling  point  notation. 

An  approach  for  enhancing  detectability  in 

this  problem  area  is  the  employment  of  an 
antenna  array.  The  antenna  array  collects 
spatial  samples  of  the  signal  and  noise  fields. 
Key  issues  are  (1)  optimal  spatial  coupling 
(antenna  deployment),  (2)  optimal  time  process(cid:173)
ing  (receiver  structure),  and  (3)  the  performance 
improvement  resulting  from  use  of  antenna  array 
collection.  The  time  optimal  processing  issue  for 
the  general  case  of  detecting  a  random  signal  in 
random  noise  with  an  array  receiver  has  been 
resolved  by  Middleton  and  Groginsky5  and  by 
VanTrees.6  However,  efforts  toward  determining 
exact  receiver  performance  and  optimal  coupling 
have  been  less  successful  for  both  array  and 
single  antenna  coupling.  This  paper  analytically 
develops  the  relationships  essential  for  an  exact 
performance  evaluation  for  the  antenna  array  case. 

Problem  Formulation 

Statistical  Model 

The  incident  signal  coupled  by  the  n  ele(cid:173)
ments  of  the  antenna  array  is  represented  by  a 
column  vectorx(t),  and  is  assumed  to  contain  a 
signal  component  and  a  noise  component  under 
the  indicated  hypothesis  structure. 

(1) 

The  restriction  to  the  "on-off"  case  is  made  to 
render  the  mathematics  less  cumbersome,  and 
its  removal  is  a  straightforward  extension  of  the 
results  contained  herein.  The  amplitude  time 
structure  of  the  signal  s.(t)  to  be  detected  can  be 
a  narrow  band,  complex  stochastic  process  y_(t) 
which  has  been  modulated  with  some  determinis(cid:173)
tic  and  possibly  complex  narrow  band  function 
f(t)  7 

If  the  carrier  frequency  is  w  ,  then 

(2) 
The  orthogonal  components  of y.(t)  are  assumed  to 
be  Gaussian  distributed  and  independent.  This 
model  can  be  used  to represent  situations  such 
as  multiplicative  Rayleigh  fading  with  a uniformly

Optimal  Antenna  Dimensions 

In  order  to  maximize  system  performance  it 
is  necessary  to  simultaneously  make  Pf  as  small 
and  PD  as  large  as  p o s s i b l e.  This  is  done  by 
maximizing  the  difference  between  the  arguments 
in  (44),  or  e q u i v a l e n t l y,  by  maximizing  the  square 
of  the  difference  w h i ch  is 

i . e.  , 

if  a ll  the  noise  is  assumed  to  be 

n e g l l c t e d, 
received  through  the  antennas.  Singular  detec(cid:173)
t i on  occurs  when  the  sN(W)  matrix  becomes 
s i n g u l a r2  and  two  such  cases  need  to  be  d i s t i n(cid:173)
g u i s h e d. 

In  the  f i r st  case  y  is  maximized  for  zero 
i . e.  ,  when  the  antennas  are 
located  at  the  same  p o i n t .12  Later  in 

antenna  s p a c i n g s, 
(ideally) 
this  report  it  is  shown  that  the  SN  matrix  becomes 
singular  for  zero  spacings  so  that  y  appears  to 
become  unbounded.  The  physical  s i g n i f i c a n ce  of 
this  phenomenon  is  that  for  zero  spacings  the 
noises  in  the  antennas  are  identical  and  the 
optimum  receiver  structure  phases  and  sums  the 
antenna  voltages  In  such  a  way  as  to  completely 
eliminate  the  n o i s e.  Unfortunately  the  desired 
signals  In  the  antennas  are  also  Identical  and  are 
also  completely  eliminated  by  the  optimum 
r e c e i v e r. 

The  second  case  involves  plane  wave  noise 

y i e l d i ng  noises  In  the  antennas  as  delayed  ver(cid:173)
sions  of  each  other.  Thus  It  Is  theoretically 
possible  to  completely  eliminate  the  external 
noise  without  e l i m i n a t i ng  the  signal  provided  the 
signal  Is  not  received  from  the  same  d i r e c t i on  as 
the  n o i s e. 
theoretically  the  same  for  a ll  non-zero  antenna 
s p a c i n g s.  The  plane  wave  noise  Is  therefore  not 
considered  further  In  regard  to  optimal  antenna 
s p a c i n g. 

In  this  case  the  performance  Is 

The  zero  spacings  s o l u t i on  is  i n v a l id  as  is 

also  evident  from  the  fact  that  for  singular 
detection  the  threshold  assumption  no  longer 
holds  since  the  inequality  In  equation  (40) 
is 
r e v e r s e d. 
If  the  threshold  assumption  does  not 
h o l d,  then  equation  (55)  for  Y  IS  Invalid  and  it  is 
no  longer  evident  that  the  optimum  procedure  is  to 
maximize  Y. 

In  order  to  obtain  p h y s i c a l ly  meaningful 

results  It  is  necessary  to  avoid  the  s p a t i a l ly 
singular  detection  s i t u a t i o n.  This  is  done  by 
including  an  additive  receiver  noise  whose 
s t a t i s t i c al  properties  are  independent  of  the 
antenna  s p a c i n g s.  The  receiver  noise  need  not 
be  white  but  may  reasonably  be  assumed  uncor(cid:173)

desLrable  to  simplify  the  analytical  task  by finding 
some  simpler  expression  which  Is  maximal  for  the 
same  antenna  deployment  that  maximizes  y.  The 
cases  under  which  this  is  possible  will  now  be 
developed. 

A  considerable  simplification  results  If  max(cid:173)

imizing  the  Integrand  Is  the  same  as  maximizing 
the  Integral.  The  development  which  maximizes 
the  Integrand  will  be  a  function  of w  unless  the 
Integrand  can  be  factored  Into  the  product  of  a 
function  of  only  the  deployment  and  a  function  of 
frequency  alone.  With  physically  realistic 
antenna  cross  correlation  spectra  such  a  factor(cid:173)
ization  Is  not  possible.  Thus  the  two  maximiza(cid:173)
tions  coincide  only  If  the  optimal  deployment  for 
the  Integral  equals  that  for  the  Integrand 
evaluated  at  a  particular  frequency;  w  ,  perhaps 
the  carrier  frequency.  This  In  turn  occurs  only 
when  the  Integrand  contains,  as  a  factor, 
6(w-  w)0).  If  the  signal  covarlance  matrix  contains 
a  common  spectral  term  [S (W)=S (w) P  (w))]  then 

s 

s 

Is  sometimes  called  the  array  gain  function  since 
It  represents  the  SNR  gain  effected  by  the  antenna 
array.  The  maximization  of  the  antenna  gain 
function  by  Gaarder13,14  Is  valid  only  for  narrow 
band  plane  wave  signals  (requiring  that  S2(W) 
approximate  a  delta  function). 

The  Integrand  can  also  be  simplified  by 

further  selection  of  the  SN  and  P  matrices.  That 

~N  â€”s 

this  Is  the  case  might  be  suspected  because  these 
matrices  have  the  often  convenient  properties  of 
being  Hermltlan  and  positive  definite.  The  pro(cid:173)
duct  SNTs  is  Hermltlan  only  If  S!"  and  Ps 
commute.  S"  and  Pâ€ž  will  commute  If  and  only  If 
they  have  the  same  eigenvectors,  or  equlvalently 
If  SN  Is  a  scalar  function  of Â£s,  or  vice  versa. 
(Note  that  these  statements  are  true  only  because 
S_N  and  Ps  are  Hermltlan.)  For  the  physically 
realizable  cross  covarlance  spectra  considered  In 
this  report,  the  restriction  that  S.N  be  a  scalar 
function  of  Ps  requires  that  the  additive  receiver 
noise  be  uncorrelated  and  that  the  external  noise 
and  signal  sources  be  of  the  same  type. 

It  would  be  much  simpler  to  maximize  Â£  \{ 
1=1 
l 
Instead,  but  the  two  maximizations  do  not  In 
general  coincide.  There  are  two  obvious  cases 
In  which  the  maximizations  do  coincide,  these 
being  (1)  when  all  the  X's  are  equal  and  (2)  when 
all  the  X's  except  one  are  zero. 

If  all  the  X's  are  equal,  then  (assuming  A 

Is  normal)  A  Is  similar  to  a  scalar  multiple  of  the 
Identity  matrix  and  hence  Is  Itself  a  scalar  mul(cid:173)
tiple  of  the  Identity  matrix.  This  in  turn  would 
require  SN  to  be  a  scalar  function  of Ps ,  which 
Is  not  possible  here  because  of  the  assumed 
additive  receiver  noise.  Thus  the  case  In  which 
the  X's  are  all  equal  Is  physically  unrealistic. 
If  all  but  one  of  the  X's  are  zero,  then  A 

must  have  rank  1  and  hence Ps must  have  rank  1. 

Case  Study 

At  this  point  It  Is  desirable  to  Investigate 
(1)  specific  functional  forms  for  the  signal  and 
noise  statistics  and  (2)  the  plane  wave  signal 
case  without  the  benefit  of  the  threshold  assump(cid:173)
tion.  These  will  be  considered  as  the  case studies. 

Physically  Relevant  Space-Time  Correlation  and 
Power  Spectra  Models 

If  physically  meaningful  conclusions  are  to 

be  obtained,  physically  realistic  space-time 
covarlance  functions  must  be  employed.  The 
system  designer  must  first  model  the  physical 
noise  field  environment  and  then  use  the  model  to 
obtains;  (w)  and  hence  Â£N(w).  The  procedures 
Involved,  and  some  representative  results  will 
now  be  considered. 

A  treatment  of  this  aspect  has  been  given 
by  Chlldersl 5ln  terms  of  a  vector  antenna  height 
function  h(a>;0,cp)  of  the  antennas  used,  which  Is

The  c o n t r i b u t i on  of  this  paper  c o n s i s ts  of 

(1)  an  a n a l y t i c al  development  of  the  exact  charac(cid:173)
t e r i s t ic  functions  for  the  test  s t a t i s t ic  computed 
by  a  time  optimum  data  processing  system 
employing  m u l t i p le  antennas  for  a  random  signal 

In  the  threshold  case  the  test  s t a t i s t ic  is 

its  p . d . f. 

Gaussian  distributed  and  hence 
is 
uniquely  determined  by  its  f i r st  two  moments. 
Even  in  non-threshold  situations  the  accuracy  to 
w h i ch  the  signal  and  noise  f i e l ds  can  be  s t a t i s(cid:173)
t i c a l ly  characterized  may  preclude  a  more  accurate 
representation  of  the  test  s t a t i s t ic  p . d . f. 
the  threshold  assumption  w i ll  probably  y i e ld 
results  w h i ch  are  as  meaningful  as  can  be  obtained 
even  in  non-threshold  situations  unless  an 
unusually  accurate  s t a t i s t i c al  formulation  is 
p o s s i b l e. 

Thus 

It  is  of  interest  to  note  the  general  effects 
of  the  array  upon  reception  c a p a b i l i ty  for  specific 
c l a s s es  of  random  noise  fields  and  fading  signal 
f i e l ds  in  terms  of  their  space-time  correlation 
structure  and  array  deployment.  These  aspects 
are  currently  being  pursued  through  a  detailed 
i n v e s t i g a t i on  of  a  number  of  special  situations 
by  the  authors  and  w i ll  be  presented  in  a  later 
report.  A  thorough  d i s c u s s i on  of  anticipated 
results  is  at  this  time  premature  but  a  number  of 
speculations  can  be  projected: 

(1)  Performance  capacity  can 

Increase  w i th 

the  number  of  antennas,  n,  but  the  extent  of  any 
Improvement,  as  w e ll  as  incremental  g a i n, 
greatly  dependent  upon  the  space-time  correlation 
of  the  signal  and  noise  f i e l ds  and  the  antenna 
geometry  employed. 

is 

(2)  Deploying  antennas  so  as  to  increase 

the  noise  c r o s s - c o r r e l a t i on  between  antennas 
increases  the  performance  c a p a b i l i t y,  assuming 
that  the  deployment  does  not  render  a  similar 
effect  upon  signal  c r o s s - c o r r e l a t i on  between 
antennas.  For  e x a m p l e, 
for  f u l ly  correlated 
( s p a t i a l ly  coherent)  noise  between  antennas, 
the 
Interesting  case  of  singular  detection  is  obtained 
in  w h i ch  t h e o r e t i c a l ly  the  noise  can  be  completely

eliminated  if  that  noise  is  the  only  source  of 
interference  and  the  antenna's  front  end  can  be 
ignored. 

(3)  The  effect  of  signal  cross-correlation 
between  antennas  (correlated  fading)  is  such  that 
increasing  this  correlation,  by  appropriate  antenna 
deployment,  will  Increase  the  combined  signal  to 
noise  level,  but  will  also  increase  the  "outage 
rate"  due  to  spatially  correlated  fading.  Thus 
deploying  antennas  to  increase  signal  cross-cor(cid:173)
relation  under  these  conditions  increases  perfor(cid:173)
mance  capacity  if  SNR  gain  is  the  criteria  and 
decreases  performance  capacity  if  signal  loss  or 
outage  rate  is  the  criteria. 

It  should  be  emphasized  that  physically 

realistic  space  time  correlation  models  are  used 
in  the  preceding  analysis.  The  set  of  cross-
power  spectra  cited  in  .his  paper  should  realisti(cid:173)
