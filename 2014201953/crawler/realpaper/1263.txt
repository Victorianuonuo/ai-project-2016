EXPERIMENT NUMBER TOW 

The  accompanying  plan  and  photograph  represent 

an  e x i s t i ng  bathroom  plan  for  one  model  of 

a  home  sold  by  Pearson  Developers  in  C a l i f o r n i a. 

This  model  of  house  has  not  sold  w e l l.  The  sales 

personnel  have  heard  prospective  buyers  remark 

on  the  poor  design  of  the  bath.  Several  comments 

are  remembered: 

" t h at  sink  wastes  space";"I  was 

hoping  to  f i nd  a  more  luxurious  b a t h ".  You  are  hired 

to  remodel  the  e x i s t i ng  baths  and  propose  changes 

f or  a ll  f u t u re  ones, 

(these  should  be  the  same) 

The  house  is  the  cheapest  model  of  a  group  of 

models  s e l l i ng  between  23,000  and  35,000. 

It 

is 

two  stories  with  a  ranch  s t y le  e x t e r i o r.  The  bath 

is  at  the  end  of  a  h a ll  serving  two  bedrooms  and 

guests. 

You  are  to  come  up  with  a  t o t al  design  concept. 

The  developer  is  w i l l i ng  to  spend  more  for  the 

new  design  --  up  to  f i f ty  c o l l a r s.  For  a ll  other 

questions,  Mr.  bastman  w i ll  serve  as  c l i e n t.  Me
