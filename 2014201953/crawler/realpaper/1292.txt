This  approach

the  problem  of  r e l i a b ly  separating  and

the  parser  on  the  basis  of  a  wide  range  of  syntactic,

Both  strategies  are  designed  to  deal  with  "choice

alternatives  for  continuing  the  parse  but  not  enough

used  to  i d e n t i fy  optional  components  in  the  grammar.

where  optname  is  a  unique  name  for  t h is  option, 
o p t p r l o r i t i es  evaluates  to  a  pair  of  p r i o r i t i e s,  and 
e1  .  .  .  en  specify  the  optional  action.  The  f i r st  of 
the  p r i o r i t i es  is  assigned  to  a  process  that  w i ll

w i ll  simply  go  d i r e c t ly  to  the  successor  of  the  OPTION. 

w i th  an  adjective  or  noun.  The  statement  following 
the  ALT  controls  the  parsing  of  optional  adjectives 
and  the  head  noun.  These  are  not  allowed  after  a 
THINGPRON,  are  optional  after  either  a  DEMONSTRATIVEADJ 
or  a  QUANTIFIER,  and  are  required  in  a ll  other  cases. 
This  is  represented  in  the  program  by  an  OPTIONALIF 
inside  a  COND.  The  f i n al  statement  of  NOUNGROUP  looks 
for  modifying  r e l a t i ve  clauses  or  prepositional  phrases.

An  Example 

Having  discussed  the  major  elements  of  the  parser, 
we  w i ll  now  present  a  sample  grammar  for  a  noun  phrase

"some  narrow  pieces" 
"something" 
"everything  green" 
"he,"  " i t" 

A ll  of  these  except  the  pronouns  can  be  followed 
by  a  sequence  of  modifying  phrases.  Relative  clauses 
such  as  "which  you  dropped"  and  "that  was  picked  up" 
or  prepositional  phrases  such  as  "on  the  f l o o r"  and 
"under  the  table"  are  modifying  phrases. 

Word  V e r i f i er 

Another  important  part  of  the  parsing  system  is 

the  word  v e r i f i e r.  This  component 
testa  acoustic  data 
for  the  presence  of  words  from  such  terminal  categories 
as  noun,  verb,  and  adjective  that  are  predicted  by  the 
parser  according  to  some  path  through  the  grammar.  The 
words  in  the  terminal  category  can  be  thought  of  as 
alternatives,  exactly 
natives  in  the  grammar, 
order  of  t h e ir  l i k e l i h o o d. 
natives  and  p r i o r i t i es  is  here  found  on  the  level  of 
word  v e r i f i c a t i o n.  Estimated  likelihoods  can  not  only

defer  acoustic  processing  as 
alternatives  remain  to  be  explored.

PATHS  and  MAPS 

In  the  word  v e r i f i e r,  we  have  seen  how  one  pro(cid:173)

the 

cess  can  use  information  gained  by  another; 
results  of  a  v e r i f i c a t i on  function  can  be  used  by  a 
subsequent  process  looking  for  the  game  word.  The 
next  step  is  to  share  the  syntactic  structures  that 
are  found.  But  the  processes  may  have  had  d i f f e r e nt 
contextual  constraints  and  may  need  to  make  d i f f e r e nt 
t e s t s,  problems  for  direct  sharing.  We  have  added 
PATHS  and  MAPS  to  the  parsing  system  to  f a c i l i t a te

A  path  describes  the  flow  of  control  through  the

For  example,  at  ALT  statements  the  name  of  the  a l t e r(cid:173)

structure  of  the  path  is  a  l i st  of  names  and  words  with 
the  most  recent  history  of

followed  by  a  process  when  it  successfully  parsed  some

records  the  map  before  it  returns,  and  it  checks  for  a
