Notice  that  the  model  assumes  a  two-lane  highway. 
Using  the  lav  dealing  w i th  passing  on  the  r i g ht  on 
two-lane  highways  we  f i nd  that  the  answer  is  NO.  The 
next  question,  "Why?"  is  answered  by  using  the  reason, 
PASSING  ON  THE  SHOULDER  IS  PROHIBITED. 

The  next  question  is 

Two  cars  are  approaching  an  unmarked  i n t e r s e c t i on 
from  d i f f e r e nt  d i r e c t i o n s.  Who  has  the  r i g h t-

Because  the  law  is  straightforward, 
who  has  the  right-of-way  but  what  are  the  r e l a t i ve 
directions  of  the  two  cars. 

the  problem  is  not

asked  which  of  the  interpretations  is  intended.  When 
the  information  is  given,  the  question  can  be  answered 
and  the  proper  response,  THE  CAR  PROCEEDING  WEST,  is 
given. 

V.  Concluding  Remarks 

We  have  described  techniques  for  semantic  model(cid:173)

ing  in  a  deductive  question-answering  system.  The 
system  can  maintain  a  dialog  and  is  able  to  understand 
situations  which  can  be  expressed  as  a  series  of 
sequential  time-frames.  The  system  has  the  a b i l i ty  to 
f i l l - in  information  which  corresponds  roughly  to  those 
assumptions  that  might  normally  be  made  by  a  person. 
The  system  can  ask  specific  relevant  questions  of  the 
user  because  it  knows  which  subgoal

based  upon  the  tags  l e ft  by  successfully  using  the 
laws.  The  specialists  can  set  up  r e l a t i ve  scenes, 
f i ll  in  detailed  assumptions  about  situations,  and  set 
up  scene  modifiers.
