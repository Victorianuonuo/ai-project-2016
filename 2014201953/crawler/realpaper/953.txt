Abstract

We introduce and analyze q-potential games and q-
congestion games, where q is a positive integer. A
1-potential (congestion) game is a potential (con-
gestion) game. We show that a game is a q-potential
game if and only if it is (up to an isomorphism)
a q-congestion game. As a corollary, we derive
the result that every game in strategic form is a q-
congestion game for some q.
It is further shown
that every q-congestion game is isomorphic to a q-
network game, where the network environment is
deﬁned by a directed graph with one origin and one
destination. Finally we discuss our main agenda:
The issue of representing q-congestion games with
non-negative cost functions by congestion models
with non-negative and monotonic facility cost func-
tions. We provide some initial results in this regard.

1 Introduction

Models of congestion come with many real-life stories and
in various mathematical forms. They seem to originate at
transportation engineering [Wardrop, 1952], and they have
been analyzed by several researchers from various additional
ﬁelds, in particular computer science, communication net-
works, economics, and game theory.1 Every congestion
model gives rise to a game in strategic form (normal form).

Our starting point is the model of [Rosenthal, 1973]. A
congestion form is deﬁned by a ﬁnite set of players, each of
which holding one unit of goods, a ﬁnite set of facilities, and
per-unit cost functions associated with the facilities. Each
player must use a subset of facilities in order to make its unit
of goods valuable. The non-empty set of feasible subsets of
facilities is player-speciﬁc. When a player chooses a subset of
facilities her per-facility cost depends on the number of other
players that decide to use the facility, and her total cost is the
sum of costs of the facilities in this subset.

Each congestion form F deﬁnes a game in strategic form,
ΓF , which is called a congestion game. In ΓF the strategy set
of a player is her set of feasible subsets of facilities, and her
cost function is as described above. The distinction between

unify the research.

congestion forms and congestion games is important. The
form, which is also a sort of game, contains more informa-
tion than its associated game in strategic form. Two distinct
forms may induce isomorphic games. This distinction resem-
bles the distinction between an extensive-form game and its
associated strategic form game. For example, a congestion
game rarely reveals the structure of the facility cost func-
tions. Indeed, one can think of various natural solution con-
cepts for a congestion form that have no sense in its associated
game. For example, the players can choose the facilities se-
quentially, which gives rise to a multistage game in which we
can deal with subgame perfect equilibria and other solution
concepts that are natural in multistage games. On the other
hand, many interesting conceptual or computational concepts
for congestion forms require as input only the game. For ex-
ample, Nash equilibrium, strong equilibrium, correlated equi-
librium, social surplus, and price of anarchy. Two congestion
forms are said to be equivalent if they generate isomorphic
games.2

Many applications of congestion forms/games come from
networks. Hence, one may wish to consider a special type
of congestion forms/games, in which facilities are edges in
graphs and feasible subset of facilities are routes. It is natural
to call such congestion forms network forms, and their asso-
ciated congestion games network games. A natural question
is how much we lose when we restrict attention to network
forms. There are many modeling choices to make. We have
decided to take the seemingly most restrictive deﬁnition: A
network form is deﬁned by a directed graph with only one
origin and one destination. Nevertheless, we prove that deal-
ing with networks does not restrict the generality. We prove
that every congestion form is equivalent to a network form,
or equivalently, that every congestion game is isomorphic to
a network game. Hence, all other potential candidates for the
term network games are isomorphic to network games in our
sense, because they are in particular congestion games.

Much of the work on congestion games/forms has been in-
spired by the fact proved in [Rosenthal, 1973] that every such
game has a potential function. The theory of general games
that possess potential functions, i.e., of potential games was

2Unfortunately, there is no explicit distinction in the CS/AI liter-
ature between forms and games. Both are referred to as congestion
games.

developed in [Monderer and Shapley, 1996], where the con-
verse to Rosenthal’s theorem was proved: Every potential
game is isomorphic to a congestion game. However, there
are two major differences between the proof that every poten-
tial game is isomorphic to a congestion game, and the proof
that every congestion game is isomorphic to a network game.
First, the proof that every congestion game is isomorphic to
a network game is based on a transformation that transforms
every congestion form to an equivalent network form. The
number of facilities in the network form is twice the num-
ber of facilities in the congestion form. Hence we do not lose
computational efﬁciency. In contrast the transformation given
in [Monderer and Shapley, 1996] is not computationally efﬁ-
cient.3

The second difference concerns the issue of preserving
economics properties. The transformation given in this pa-
per that transforms congestion forms to equivalent network
forms, preserves the properties of both non-negativity and
monotonicity of facility-cost functions.As we show in this
manuscript the transformation in [Monderer and Shapley,
1996] does not preserve any of these properties. As all re-
sults in CS/AI on network games were proved with various
types of monotonicity and non-negativity assumptions, the
topic of faithful representation of potential games by con-
gestion games is important if one wants to generalize these
results to general potential games. We present here some par-
tial results in this regard.

In this paper we actually deal with the above mentioned
issues in a more general context. We discuss a generaliza-
tion of congestion forms (games), in which the facility cost
functions are player-speciﬁc. This assumption on the facil-
ity cost functions is natural in many applications. Forms
with player-speciﬁc cost functions are called PS-congestion
forms, and their associated games in strategic form are called
PS-congestion games.4 We also deﬁne and discuss PS-
congestion forms (games) of type q, or in short, q-congestion
forms (games), where q is a positive integer. A PS-congestion
form is of type q if the set of vectors of facility cost functions
contains at most q distinct vectors, that is there exist at most q
types of players. A 1-congestion form (game) is a congestion
form (game).

Similarly we introduce a new type of games: q-potential
games. A 1-potential game is simply a potential game.
Roughly speaking, a game is a q-potential game if the set
of players can be partitioned into q non-empty and mutually
disjoint subsets Nj, 1 ≤ j ≤ q, in such a way that if we ﬁx
the strategies of all players outside Nj, the remaining sub-
game is a potential game. We show that the proof of equiva-
lence between potential games and congestion games can be
extended. That is, every q-congestion game is a q-potential
game, and every (ﬁnite) q-potential game is isomorphic to
a q-congestion game. We notice that every game is an n-

3The transformation in the proof is linear in the parameters, and
[Monderer and Shapley, 1996] gave a lower bound to the number of
facilities required by this transformation to represent a given poten-
tial game by a congestion game. It is an open question to us whether
a computationally efﬁcient transformation exists.

4Simple and facility symmetric PS-congestion forms/games (see

Deﬁnition 1) were already discussed, e.g., in [Milchtaich, 1996].

potential game, where n is the number of players. Therefore,
we conclude that every game in strategic form is isomorphic
to an n-congestion game. Hence, we get the somewhat sur-
prising result that every game in strategic form is isomorphic
to a PS-congestion game.5

We further prove that for every q ≥ 1, every q-congestion
form is equivalent to a q-network form. That is, every game
in strategic form is isomorphic to a PS-network game.

function of i, where X = ×i∈N Xi. Γ is called a ﬁnite game
if the sets of strategies are ﬁnite sets. We say that two games

are isomorphic if each of them is obtained from
the other by changing the names of the players and the names
of the strategies. That is, there exist bijection functions (i.e.,
functions which are both one-to-one and onto) τ : N 1 → N 2
and αi : X 1

2.2 Potential games
Let Γ = (N, (Xi)i∈N , (Ci)i∈N ) be a game in strategic form.
Let X−i denote the set of strategy proﬁles of all players but
i. A function P : X → R is a potential function6 for i if for

5In some contexts it is useful to consider congestion forms,
which generalize PS-congestion forms. In such forms the facility
cost functions are not only player-speciﬁc, but also depend on the
identity of the users of the facility. We call such forms ID-congestion
forms. Classical ID-congestion forms are congestion forms with
weights. Relationships between congestion games, ID-congestion
games, and the Shapley value were given for example in [Monderer
and Shapley, 1996; Ui, 2000; Monderer, 2006]. Another type of gen-
eralization of congestion forms is local-effect games [Leyton-Brown
and Tennenholtz, 2003], in which nodes in a graph represent actions,
cost functions are associated with nodes, and every such cost func-
tion depends on the number of users of the neighboring nodes. These
type of games were generalized in [Bhat and Leyton-Brown, 2004]
to action-graph games, which were proved to have full expressive
power.

6In [Monderer and Shapley, 1996], four types of potential func-
tions were deﬁned: exact potential, weighted potential, ordinal po-
tential, and generalized ordinal potential. The term “potential”
was used interchangeably with the term “exact potential”.
In re-
cent literature, some other types of potentials have been considered.
For example, best-response potential [Voorneveld, 2000], pseudo-
potentials ([Dubey et al., 2006]), ,various types of strong potentials
[Holzman and Law-yone (Lev-tov), 1997], potential functions for
mechanism design [Jehiel et al., 2004], several types of potential
functions that represent various acyclicity properties [Kukushkin,
2002; 2004], and generalized potential functions [Moriss and Ui,
2004]. In some other works, the term potential is used for ordinal or
generalized ordinal potentials. In this paper we keep the terminology
of [Monderer and Shapley, 1996].

Ci(xi, x−i) − Ci(yi, x−i) = P (xi, x−i) − P (yi, x−i).

Following [Monderer and Shapley, 1996], Γ is a potential
game if there exists a function P which is a potential for every
player i.

2.3 Congestion forms and congestion games
For the basic model of congestion forms and congestion
games we follow [Rosenthal, 1973] and [Monderer and Shap-
ley, 1996].

Congestion

=
(M, N, (Σi)i∈N , (ca)a∈M ), where M is a ﬁnite set
consisting of m elements, which are called facilities, N is a
ﬁnite set consisting of n elements, which are called players;
For every i ∈ N , Σi ⊆ 2M \ {∅} is a non empty set of
subsets of facilities, which is called the feasible set of i, and
for every a ∈ M ca : [0, ∞) → R is the per-unit facility cost
function associated with a ∈ M ; If k of the users choose a,
each of them pays ca(k).

Every congestion form F = (M, N, (Σi)i∈N , (ca)a∈M )
deﬁnes a game in strategic form ΓF , in which the set of play-
ers is N , Σi is the set of strategies of i, and for every i ∈ N
the cost function of player i is deﬁned on Σ = ×i∈N Σi as
follows:

(cid:2)

Ci(A) = Ci(A1, · · · , An) =

ca(na(A)),

a∈Ai

where na(A) = |{j ∈ N : a ∈ Aj}|.7 A game Γ in strategic
form is called a congestion game if Γ = ΓF for some con-
gestion form F . Two congestion forms are equivalent if they
generate isomorphic congestion games.

2.4 Player-speciﬁc facility cost functions
When the cost functions associated with the facilities are
player-speciﬁc we get a congestion form with player-
speciﬁc facility cost functions or, in short a PS-congestion
form. Formally: A PS-Congestion Form is a tuple F =
(M, N, (Σi)i∈N , ((ci
a)a∈M )i∈N ) such that all components
except for the cost functions are deﬁned as in a congestion
a : [0, ∞) → R is i’s facility cost function asso-
form, and ci
ciated with a ∈ M ; If k of the users choose a, agent i pays
ci
a(k).
Deﬁnition 1 A PS-congestion form is facility-symmetric if
Σi = Σj for every i, j ∈ N . A PS-congestion form is simple
if Σi contains only singletons for every player i.
=
F
Every
(M, N, (Σi)i∈N , ((ci
a)a∈M )i∈N ) uniquely deﬁnes a game in
strategic form ΓF , in which the set of players is N , Σi is the
set of strategies of i, and for every i ∈ N the cost function of
player i is deﬁned as follows:

PS-congestion

form

A game Γ in strategic form is called a PS-congestion game if
Γ = ΓF for some PS-congestion form F . Thus, every con-
gestion form is a PS-congestion form, and every congestion
game is a PS-congestion game.

q-Congestion forms and q-congestion games

2.5
Roughly speaking, a PS-congestion form is of type q if the
players can be partitioned into q types, where two players are
of the same type if they share the same facility cost functions.
Formally, Let F = (M, N, (Σi)i∈N , ((ci
a)a∈M )i∈N ) be a
[0,∞))M
PS-congestion form. A ﬁnite set K ⊆ (R
is a cover
for F if for every player i there exists c = (ca)a∈M ∈ K
such that for every a ∈ M ci

a = ca.

a)a∈M , · · · , (cn

Let q be a positive integer. We say that F is a q-congestion
form if it has a cover H with |H| ≤ q. Obviously, if F is
a q−congestion form, F is a (q + 1)-congestion form. Be-
cause K = {(c1
a )a∈M } is a cover for F , every
n−person PS-congestion form is an n-congestion form. Let
1 ≤ q(F ) ≤ n be the index of F , deﬁned as the minimal car-
dinality of a cover for F . Obviously, F is a congestion form
if and only if q(F ) = 1. If F is a q-congestion form, ΓF is
called a q-congestion game.

q-Potential games

2.6
Let Γ = (N, (Xi)i∈N , (Ci)i∈N ) be a game in strategic form.
Let H be a set of real-valued functions deﬁned on X. We say
that H is a cover of Γ if for every i ∈ N there exists P ∈ H,
which is a potential function for i. Let q be a positive integer.
We say that Γ is a q-potential game if it has a cover H with
|H| ≤ q. Obviously, if Γ is a q−potential game, Γ is a (q+1)-
potential game. Because Ci itself is a potential for i, every
n−person game is an n-potential game. Let 1 ≤ q(Γ) ≤ n
be the potential index of Γ, deﬁned as the minimal cardinality
of a cover for Γ. Obviously, Γ is a potential game, if and only
if Γ is a 1-potential game if and only if q(Γ) = 1.

Let Γ be a q-potential game . Let H = {P1, · · · , Pq},
|H| = q, be a cover of Γ, and let Hs be the set of all play-
ers i such that Ps is a potential function for i. A partition of
the player set N to q nonempty and mutually disjoint sub-
sets π = (Ns)q
s=1, is consistent with H if Ps is a poten-
tial function for every i ∈ Ns, that is, Ns ⊆ Hs for ev-
ery 1 ≤ s ≤ q. In a potential game with a potential func-
tion P , all players behave as if there exists one player whose
goal is to minimize P over X. In a q-potential game with
a cover H = {P1, · · · , Pq} and an H-consistent partition
π = (Ns)q
s=1, the players behave as if there are q players,
Is, 1 ≤ s ≤ q, playing a q-person game with the set of
strategies X[s] for player Is, where X[s] = ×i∈Ns
Xi. For
x = (x[s])1≤s≤q, the cost function of Is is Ps. Note that ev-
ery equilibrium x in the associated q-person game is also an
equilibrium in the original game. Similarly, every correlated
equilibrium corresponds to a correlated equilibrium.8

ci(A) = ci(A1, · · · , An) =

(cid:2)

a∈Ai

ci
a(na(A)).

Unfortunately, as is shown in the next example, a cover
with a minimal cardinality may have more than one consistent
partition. In particular, the partition of the players’ set to q

7Hence, only the values of ca on the set of integers {1, · · · , n}
are relevant. However, it will be useful later, and it does not restrict
the generality, to deﬁne ca on the whole interval [0, ∞).

8However, a mixed-strategy equilibrium in the associated q-
person game corresponds only to a correlated equilibrium in the
original game, and not necessarily to a mixed-strategy equilibrium.

subsets in a q-potential game with an index q is not uniquely
determined by the game. Bellow is an example for a 3-player
game with a potential index 2 in which both partitions 12, 3
and 1, 23 are consistent with the same cover H, where |H| =
2.
Example 1 We construct a game Γ. The strategy set of ev-
ery player 1 ≤ i ≤ 3 is {0, 1}. The cost functions are:
C1(x) = C1(x1, x2, x3) = x2x3, C2(x) = x1x3, C3(x) =
x1x3 + x1x2. We ﬁrst show that this is not a 1-potential
game. Indeed, by [Monderer and Shapley, 1996] it sufﬁces
to show that there exists a closed path of strategy proﬁles in
X, γ = x(0), x(1), x(2), x(3), x(4) with x(0) = x(4), such
that x(t + 1) is obtained from x(t) by changing the strategy
of exactly one player, it, 0 ≤ t ≤ 3, and such that I(γ) (cid:9)= 0,
where

Indeed,
(0, 1, 0), (1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 0), I(γ) = −1.
Observe that P (x) = 0 for every x ∈ X is a potential
function for both player 1 and player 2, and that C2 is a
potential function for both player 2 and player 3. Hence,
H = {0, C2} is a cover for Γ, and both partitions 12, 3 and
1, 23 are consistent with H.

2.7 Representation of q-potential games by

q-congestion forms

It was proved in [Rosenthal, 1973] that every congestion
game is a potential game. It was proved in [Monderer and
Shapley, 1996] that every ﬁnite potential game is isomorphic
to a congestion game. The two theorems are extended in this
section.

Theorem 1
(1) Every q-congestion game is a q-potential game.
(2) Every ﬁnite q-potential game is isomorphic to a q-
congestion game.

The proof of Theorem 1 is given in the full version.
We end with a somewhat surprising corollary:

Corollary 1 Every game in strategic form is isomorphic to a
PS-congestion game.

Proof: As we noticed above, every game in strategic form is
an n-potential game. By Theorem 1 every n-potential game
is isomorphic to an n-congestion game.

Consider a loop-free directed graph GR with a ﬁnite set of
vertices V = VGR, and a set of edges E = EGR.9 Every
feasible subset of facilities for i represents a feasible route (a
path with distinct vertices) in the graph. For every o, d ∈ V ,
o (cid:9)= d we denote by R(o, d) the set of all routes that con-
nect o to d. A PS-network form is a PS-congestion form
F = (M, N, (Σi)i∈N , ((ci
a)a∈M )i∈N ) for which there exists
a directed graph, and two distinct vertices in this graph o and
d, with R(o, d) (cid:9)= ∅ such that M ⊆ E and Σi ⊆ R(o, d)
for every agent i. A game Γ in strategic form is called a
PS-network game if Γ = ΓF for some PS-network form F .
Naturally, a q-network form is a PS-network form of type q,
and a q-network game is a PS-network game derived from a
q-network form. A 1-network form is also called a network
form, and a 1-network game is also called a network game.
Theorem 2 Every q-congestion form is equivalent to a q-
network form.
Proof: Let F = (M, N, (Σi)i∈N , ((ci
a)a∈M )i∈N ) be a q-
congestion form. Assume M = {a1, . . . , am}, and let K =
{b1, · · · , bm} be an arbitrary ﬁnite copy of M that does not
intersect with M . We construct a graph GR as follows: The
set of vertices is V = {1, · · · , m + 1}. For every 1 ≤ j ≤ m
we connect j to j + 1 with two edges, aj, bj. That is, j is
the tail of both aj and bj, and j + 1 is the head of both. We
denote o = 1 and d = m+ 1. For every Ai ∈ Σi we associate
= z1, z2, · · · , zm, where zj = aj
a route αAi as follows: αAi
if aj ∈ Ai, and zj = bj if aj (cid:9)∈ Ai. With the edges aj we
associate the cost function (ci
)i∈N , and with the edges bj
aj
we associate the cost functions which are constantly zero. It is
obvious that we constructed a PS-network form of type q, and
that the q-network game derived from this form is isomorphic
to ΓF .

The following example together with its associated ﬁgure il-
lustrates the proof of Theorem 2.

3 Network Forms and Network Games

Much of the literature about congestion forms has been mo-
tivated by transportation systems and by digital networks. In
such models, facilities are edges in a graph, and feasible sets
of facilities are routes. In this paper the terms network form
and network game are deﬁned in a speciﬁc way. All other
graphical models fall under the category of congestion forms
(games).

Corollary 2 Every ﬁnite game in strategic form is isomor-
phic to a PS-network game.10

9One may use non-directed graphs. In this paper we basically
follows the deﬁnition of [Holzman and Law-yone (Lev-tov), 2003].
10Other graphical representations of games have been analyzed
in the literature of computer science and artiﬁcial intelligence.
In some of these representations the focus is on dependencies
among players’ utility functions (see, e.g., [Kearns et al., 2001;

4 Faithful representations

In many real-life applications it is natural to assume that the
facility cost functions of a PS-congestion form have a special
structure. In particular, it is natural to assume that the facil-
ity cost functions are nonnegative and in addition are either
non-decreasing or non-increasing, depending on the context.
It is easy to check that the particular representation method
described in the proof of Theorem 1 (or in the analogous
proof in [Monderer and Shapley, 1996]) may represent a ﬁnite
q-potential game with nonnegative costs by a q-congestion
form in which some of the facility cost functions take nega-
tive values. Actually, the representation method depends on
the choice of the potential functions. However, it can be seen
that there exists a ﬁnite 1-potential game such that for ev-
ery choice of a potential function the representation method
yields a 1-congestion form with some facility cost functions
that take negative values. This suggest three questions:
Question 1: Can every ﬁnite q-potential game with non-
negative cost functions be represented (up to an isomorphism)
by a q-congestion form with non-negative facility cost func-
tions?
Question 2: Can every ﬁnite q-potential game with non-
negative cost functions be represented (up to an isomorphism)
by a q-congestion form with non-negative and non-decreasing
cost functions?
Question 3: Can every ﬁnite q-potential game with non-
negative costs be represented (up to an isomorphism) by a
q-congestion form with non-negative and non-increasing cost
functions?

We show that the answer to Question 2 is negative by the

Example 3 Consider the following parametric game with
z > 0.

x2

y2

z

x1

y1

Γz =

Γz is a congestion game because it is a potential game with

a potential function Pz, where

Koller and Milch, 2001; Mura, 2000; Vickrey and Koller, 2002]).
Other types of representations focus on actions’ dependencies– see
[Leyton-Brown and Tennenholtz, 2003; Bhat and Leyton-Brown,
2004].

Note, however, that Γz in Example 3 can be represented
by a simple congestion game with non-negative and non-
increasing cost functions. Consider the congestion form Fz
with two resources a, b. ca(1) = ca(2) = 0. cb(1) = z, and
cb(2) = 0. It is easily veriﬁed that ΓFz is isomorphic to Γz.
Hence, Question 1 and 3 can still have positive answers.

If we are less ambitious, and we allow representing q-
potential games with r-congestion games with r > q, we
show in the full paper that the answer to the modiﬁed version
of Question 1 and 2 is positive. The proof of the following
lemma is given in the full version:

Lemma 1 Every game in strategic form with non-negative
cost functions is isomorphic to a PS-congestion game de-
rived from a PS-congestion form with non-negative and non-
decreasing facility cost functions.

We end this section with an example showing two conges-
tion forms with the same combinatorial structure (same set of
facilities and same feasible sets) and with positive cost func-
tions that represent the same game. However, the facility cost
functions in one of them are decreasing and in the other, in-
creasing.

Example 4 The two congestion forms bellow represent the
following potential game:

Γ =

Consider the parametric congestion forms F , in which
M = {a, b, c, d}, Σ1 = {{a, b}, {c, d}}, Σ2 =
{{a, c}, {d, d}}. The cost functions are

cz(1) = xz, and cz(2) = yz for every z ∈ {a, b, c, d}.

Hence, Γ can be represented by this particular congestion
form if there exists a solution to the following linear system
with 8 equations and 8 variables:

ac

bd

Γ =

ab

cd

ya + xb

yb + xa

ya + xc

yb + xd

yc + xd

yd + xc

yc + xa

yd + xb

It is easy to see that this system has solutions depending on

two parameters s, t:

xb = xc = t, yb = yc = s,

ya = 11 − t, yd = 8 − t, xa = 7 − s, xd = 12 − s.

Obviously t = 1, s = 6 gives a congestion form with pos-
itive and increasing cost functions, while t = 6, s = 1 give a
congestion form with positive and decreasing cost functions.
