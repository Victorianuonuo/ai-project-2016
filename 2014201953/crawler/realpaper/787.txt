Abstract

The paper presents and discusses a method for
rank-ordering alternatives on the basis of con-
straints induced by generic principles (expressing
for instance the relative importance of criteria), or
by examples of orderings between particular alter-
natives, without resorting to the use of an aggrega-
tion operation for evaluating the alternatives. The
approach, which remains qualitative, is based on
the minimal speciﬁcity principle of possibility the-
ory in order to complete the constraints. It is com-
pared on an illustrative example to an aggregation-
based approach using Choquet integral. The way
constraints expressed in the Choquet integral set-
ting translate into constraints in the proposed ap-
proach is discussed.

1 Introduction
A classical way for comparing alternatives is to use multi-
ple criteria for evaluating them in an absolute manner, using
linearly ordered scales. These scales are often numerical, and
under the hypothesis that are commensurable, different aggre-
gation procedures that reﬂect various combination attitudes
can be applied in order to build a complete preorder for rank-
ordering the alternatives on the basis of the global evaluations
that are obtained. However, in many practical problems (such
as multiple criteria analysis, ﬂexible constraints satisfaction
problems), a numerical scale, such as [0,1] is too rich for be-
ing used, and more qualitative scales having a ﬁnite number
of levels have to be preferred. But, the internal operations that
can be deﬁned on these latter scales (e.g., [Mas et al., 1999;
Fodor, 2000]) have a limited discriminating power since they
take values on a ﬁnite range.

The problem thus amounts to compare alternatives repre-
sented by vectors of qualitative criteria evaluations without
aggregating them. Apart from the Pareto partial preorder that
should constrain any complete preorder between alternatives,
one may have some generic rules that further constrain these
complete preorders. For instance, one may state that some
criterion is more important than, or equally important as,
other criteria (maybe in a limited context). One may also
have at our disposal some examples of preferences between
fully speciﬁed alternatives. The problem addressed here, is

then to complete the Pareto partial preorder in agreement
with the constraints in a way that is as little arbitrary as
possible.

The paper is organized as follows. The next section intro-
duces the problem formally, while Section 3 provides a short
background on a general family of aggregation functions that
can be deﬁned under the form of a Choquet integral, which
will be used in the paper as a comparison landmark. Section 4
describes the proposed approach that uses a minimal commit-
ment principle for building a complete preorder in agreement
with the constraints. This principle expresses that an alterna-
tive is good as much as there is no other alternative that are
considered to be better. Section 5 applies this approach to
constraints that directly mirror the way the comparative im-
portance of criteria is stated when using a Choquet integral
aggregation. This enables a comparison between the two ap-
proaches. Section 6 reviews related works, and points out the
new features of the proposed approach.

2 Framework
It is assumed that objects to be rank-ordered are vectors of
satisfaction levels belonging to a linearly ordered scale S =
{s1, · · · , sh} with s1 < · · · < sh, each vector component
referring to a particular criterion. Thus, it is supposed that
there exists a unique scale S on which all the criteria can be
estimated (commensurateness hypothesis).

Preferences are expressed through comparisons of such
n for short),

n} (written ai

1, · · · , ai

1 · · · ai

vectors ui = {ai
where ai

j ∈ S, under the form of constraints

n

expressing that u = a1 · · · an is preferred to (or is more sat-
isfactory than) u(cid:2) = a(cid:2)

1 · · · a(cid:2)
n.

Let U be the set of all possible vectors u = a1 · · · an, called
also alternatives, such that aj ∈ S for all j = 1, · · · , n. (cid:4) is
a pre-order on U if and only if it is a reﬂexive and transitive
relation. u (cid:3) u(cid:2) means that u (cid:4) u(cid:2) holds but not u(cid:2) (cid:4) u.
u = u(cid:2) means that both u (cid:4) u(cid:2) and u(cid:2) (cid:4) u hold, i.e. u
and u(cid:2) are equally preferred, and u ∼ u(cid:2) means that neither
u (cid:4) u(cid:2) nor u(cid:2) (cid:4) u hold, i.e. u and u(cid:2) are incomparable. (cid:4)
is said to be complete (or total) if all pairs of alternatives are
comparable.

Some components may remain unspeciﬁed when compar-
ing alternatives. They are replaced by a variable xj if the jth

component is free to take any value in the scale. This allows
to express generic preferences as for example Pareto ordering
written as
∀xi∀x(cid:2)

i, x1 · · · xn (cid:3) x(cid:2)

i and ∃k, xk > x(cid:2)
k.

1 · · · x(cid:2)

n if ∀i, xi ≥ x(cid:2)

In any case, Pareto ordering is always assumed to hold. Be-
sides, other generic constraints of particular interest include
those pertaining to the expression of the relative importance
of criteria. The greater importance of criterion j with respect
to criterion k can be expressed under different forms. One
way to state it is by exchanging xj and xk and writing
x1 · · · xj · · · xk · · · xn (cid:3) x1 · · · xk · · · xj · · · xn when xj > xk.

One may think of other ways of expressing that j is more im-
portant than k. For instance, one may restrict the above pref-
erences to extreme values of S for the xi’s such that i (cid:9)= j
and j (cid:9)= k, since weights of importance in conjunctive ag-
gregation can be obtained in this way for a large family of
operators (e.g., [Dubois et al., 2001]). A more drastic way
for expressing relative importance would be to use a lexico-
graphic ordering of the vector evaluations based on a linear
order of the levels of importance for the criteria. Then, the
problem of ordering the vectors is straightforward.
Note that the ﬁrst above view of relative importance, which is
used in the following, is a ceteris paribus preference of sub-
vector (xj , xk) with respect to (xk, xj) for xj > xk, where
the ﬁrst (resp. second) component refers to criterion j (resp.
k), which expresses preferential independence.

Another way to relate criteria is to express an equal impor-
tance between them. It can be expressed by stating that any
two vectors where xj and xk are exchanged, and otherwise
identical, have the same levels of satisfaction. Formally,

x1 · · · xj · · · xk · · · xn = x1 · · · xk · · · xj · · · xn.

It is worth noticing that transitivity is required between al-
ternatives only and not between generic constraints. More
precisely if it holds that u (cid:3) u(cid:2) and u(cid:2) (cid:3) u(cid:2)(cid:2) with respect to
some generic constraints then we necessarily have u (cid:3) u(cid:2)(cid:2).
However if we have two generic constraints X (cid:3) Y and
Y (cid:3) Z, where X, Y and Z are three criteria, representing
that X (resp. Y ) is more important than Y (resp. Z) then
we do not necessarily have X (cid:3) Z. To illustrate this, let
X, Y and Z be evaluated on a scale {a, b, c} with a > b > c.
X (cid:3) Y and Y (cid:3) Z are relative importance constraints de-
ﬁned by xyz (cid:3) yxz for x > y and xyz (cid:3) xzy for y > z
respectively. Let us now check whether we have X (cid:3) Z i.e.
xyz (cid:3) zyx for x > z. We have abc (cid:3) cba obtained by tran-
sitivity from abc (cid:3) bac (w.r.t. X (cid:3) Y ), bac (cid:3) bca (w.r.t.
Y (cid:3) Z) and bca (cid:3) cba (w.r.t. X (cid:3) Y ). However acb is
not preferred to bca since we cannot reach bca from acb by
transitivity using the generic constraints. Indeed generic con-
straints require to explicitly express each constraint that we
want to have, i.e. X (cid:3) Z in the above example.

Deﬁnition of the problem
The problem of rank-ordering the alternatives is decribed as
follows. Given a set of constraints C of the form {ui (cid:3)
ui(cid:2) |i = 1, · · · , m}, where ui
are instantiated on S, our

and ui(cid:2)

aim is to compute a complete pre-order (cid:4) over U that satis-
ﬁes all constraints of C. Such a pre-order should not add any
additional constraint. One may wonder why we compute a
complete pre-order from the set C of partially speciﬁed pref-
erences. This is a debatable question and we really believe
that the answer depends on the application. If C describes
preferences over cars then we may permit that two cars are
incomparable. However if C describes preferences over stu-
dents’ grades, as it is the case in our running examples, it is
natural to have a complete pre-order over students.
The set C may contain generic constraints as described previ-
ously but also particular examples of preferences. Note that
some pre-orders, such as those induced by the minimum ag-
gregation operator, are excluded as soon as Pareto constraints
are considered.

3 Numerical aggregation by Choquet integral

Aggregation of object attribute values in the presence of
interaction between criteria is essential in many decision
making problems. Choquet integrals are very popular ag-
gregation operators as they allow to model such interac-
tions and thus to represent preferences that cannot be cap-
tured by a simple weighted arithmetic mean [Grabisch, 1995;
1996]. Using a particular measure, they aggregate valued at-
tributes describing alternatives into a unique value. A Cho-
quet integral is based on a fuzzy measure deﬁned by:
Deﬁnition 1 Let A be the set of attributes and I(A) be the
set of all possible subsets of A. A fuzzy measure is a function
μ from I(A) to [0, 1] such that:

• ∀X, Y ∈ I(A) if X ⊆ Y then μ(X) ≤ μ(Y ).
• μ(∅) = 0, μ(A) = 1.

A discrete Choquet integral with respect to a fuzzy measure
μ is deﬁned as follows:
Deﬁnition 2 Let μ be a fuzzy measure on A = {a1, · · · , an}.
The discrete Choquet integral w.r.t. μ is deﬁned by:

(cid:2)

Chμ(a1 · · · an) =

(a(i) − a(i−1)) ∗ μA(i)

),

i=1,···,n

where a(i) indicates that the indices have been permuted so
that 0 ≤ a(1) ≤ · · · ≤ a(n), and A(i) = {a(i), · · · , a(n)} with
a(0) = 0.

Example 1 ([Grabisch, 1995; 1996; Marichal, 1998]) Let
A, B and C be three students evaluated with respect to three
subjects: mathematics (M), physics (P) and literature (L).
Students’ grades are summarized in Table 1. Using Choquet

integral with a fuzzy measure μ, the global grade for each
student is computed as follows:

• student A: Chμ(A) = Chμ(18, 16, 10) = 10 ∗ μM P L +

(16 − 10) ∗ μM P + (18 − 16) ∗ μM ,

• student B: Chμ(B) = Chμ(10, 12, 18) = 10 ∗ μM P L +

(12 − 10) ∗ μP L + (18 − 12) ∗ μL,

• student C: Chμ(C) = Chμ(14, 15, 15) = 14 ∗ μM P L +

where μX , μXY and μXY Z with X, Y, Z ∈ {M, P, L} de-
note the values of the fuzzy measure μ for the corresponding
set of subjects.
The school is more scientiﬁcally than literary oriented and
it gives the same importance to mathematics and physics.
Moreover the school wants to favor well equilibrated stu-
dents without weak grades so we should have: C preferred
to A and A preferred to B, i.e. C (cid:3) A (cid:3) B 1. As indi-
cated before, the fuzzy measure μ models interaction between
subjects. Since mathematics and physics have the same im-
portance and they are more important than literature we have
μM = μP , μM > μL and μP > μL. Moreover both math-
ematics and physics are scientiﬁc subjects, and thus are con-
sidered close, while literature is not. So the interaction be-
tween mathematics (resp. physics) and literature is higher
than the interaction between mathematics and physics. Thus
μM L = μP L > μM P . This gives the following set of con-
straints on μ: {μM = μP , μM > μL, μP > μL, μM L =
μP L, μM L > μM P , μP L > μM P }.
In addition we consider the constraints Chμ(C) > Chμ(A)
and Chμ(A) > Chμ(B) corresponding to the preference or-
der between students A, B and C. Table 2 gives an exam-
ple of measure μ satisfying all these constraints [Marichal,
1998]. Using the discrete Choquet integral w.r.t. μ given

in Table 2 we get Chμ(A) = 13.9, Chμ(B) = 13.6 and
Chμ(C) = 14.9.
Let us consider another student D having 15 in physics, 15
is mathematics and 12 in literature. Using discrete Cho-
quet integral with respect to μ given in Table 2 we get
Chμ(D) = 13.5. Then we have the following ordering
C (cid:3) A (cid:3) B (cid:3) D. Let us now use another fuzzy mea-
sure μ(cid:2) which is equal to μ except for μP L and μM L. Instead
M L = 0.8. We can check that μ(cid:2) satisﬁes
we have μ(cid:2)
the set of constraints on μ. Using discrete Choquet integral
with respect to μ(cid:2) we have C (cid:3) A (cid:3) D (cid:3) B. So we still
have C (cid:3) A (cid:3) B but the ordering over B and D is reversed.
This shows that Choquet integral is sensitive with respect to
the fuzzy measure μ and may give arbitrary order over alter-
natives that are not explicitly stated in the set of constraints.

P L = μ(cid:2)

4 A qualitative ranking approach
Since a scale more reﬁned than S is needed to rank-order the
alternatives, we use the interval [0, 1] to encode this order-

1Note that there is no weighted arithmetic mean that gives this

order over A, B and C [Marichal, 1998].

ing. Indeed S would only offer a ﬁnite number of levels for
discriminating alternatives. For this purpose, we write our
constraints in terms of a possibility distribution π, which is a
function from the set of alternatives U to [0, 1], and provides a
complete pre-order between alternatives on the basis of their
possibility degrees.

4.1 General principle
In the possibility theory framework, an elementary preference
between alternatives u (cid:3) u(cid:2) is encoded by the constraint
π(u) > π(u(cid:2)). Generally those constraints induce partial
pre-orders on the set of interpretations. Our aim is to com-
bine all these partial pre-orders and compute a total pre-order
consistent with the set of constraints. In possibility theory
we distinguish two completion principles called minimal and
maximal speciﬁcity principles that respectively generate the
largest and the smallest possibility distributions which satis-
ﬁes the set of constraints. The following deﬁnes the notion of
speciﬁcity between possibility distributions:

Deﬁnition 3 (Minimal/Maximal speciﬁcity principle) Let
π1 and π2 be two possibility distributions over U . π1 is less
speciﬁc than π2, denoted π1 ≥ π2, iff

∀u ∈ U , π1(u) ≥ π2(u).

π belongs to the set of the least (resp. most) speciﬁc possi-
bility distributions among a set of possibility distributions P
if there is no π(cid:2) in P such that π(cid:2) > π (resp. π > π(cid:2)), i.e.
π(cid:2) ≥ π holds but π ≥ π(cid:2) does not (resp. π ≥ π(cid:2) holds but
π(cid:2) ≥ π does not).
Indeed the minimal speciﬁcity principle gives the highest
possible degree to alternatives, while the maximal speciﬁcity
principle gives the lowest possible degree to alternatives.
The choice of using minimal or maximal speciﬁcity prin-
ciple depends on the application. The minimal speciﬁcity
principle used in the following amounts to consider that an
alternative is as good as permitted by the constraints. Thus,
an unconstrained alternative is good by default.

Before we present our approach it is worth noticing that
possibility distributions are purely qualitative here, although
they are encoded on the interval [0, 1], and can be represented
by a well ordered partition (E1, · · · , Ek) on U such that:

• E1 ∪ · · · ∪ Ek = U with Ei ∩ Ej = ∅ for i (cid:9)= j,
• ∀u, u(cid:2) ∈ Ei, π(u) = π(u(cid:2)),
• ∀u, u(cid:2) ∈ U , if u ∈ Ei and u(cid:2) ∈ Ej with i < j then

π(u) > π(u(cid:2)).

4.2 Minimal speciﬁcity principle-based algorithm
An elementary preference has generally the following form:

π(u) > π(u(cid:2)), u, u(cid:2) ∈ U .

(1)
For example given three criteria X, Y and Z, a relative im-
portance constraint of X over Y is written as:

π(xyz0) > π(yxz0) for x > y, ∀z0.

A set of constraints of the form (1) can be written in a com-
pact form as a set of the following constraints:

min{π(u)|u ∈ U1} > max{π(u(cid:2))|u(cid:2) ∈ U2},

(2)

IJCAI-07

395

where U1 and U2 are subsets of U .

We may also have equality constraints i.e.

π(u) = π(u(cid:2)), u, u(cid:2) ∈ U .

(3)

For example given three criteria X, Y , and Z, stating that X
and Y have the same importance is written as:

π(xyz0) = π(yxz0), ∀z0.

Algorithm 1 computes the unique least speciﬁc possibility
distribution satisfying a set of constraints C of the form (2)
(constraints (1) being a special case of constraints (2)) and
(3) obtained from generic constraints and/or examples.
Let C = {Ci : i = 1, · · · , m}. From C we deﬁne
LC = {(L(Ci), R(Ci)) : Ci ∈ C},

where L(Ci) = U1 and R(Ci) = U2 for a constraint
Ci : min{π(u)|u ∈ U1} > max{π(u(cid:2))|u(cid:2) ∈ U2}.
Let EQ = {π(uj) = π(ul)}.
Algorithm 1 [Benferhat et al., 2001] is a generalization of

Algorithm 1: The least speciﬁc possibility distribution.

begin

k = 0;
while U is not empty do

- k ← k + 1 ;
- Ek = {u|∀(L(Ci), R(Ci)) ∈ LC , u (cid:9)∈ R(Ci)} ;

α = false;

α = true, Ek = Ek\{uj, ul}

if Ek = ∅ then Stop (inconsistent statements);
- U = U\Ek ;
- From C remove (L(Ci), R(Ci)) such that L(Ci)∩
Ek (cid:9)= ∅ ;
- From EQ remove π(uj) = π(ul) s.t. uj ∈ Ek.

end
return π = (E1, · · · , Ek)

min{π(ca)} > max{π(cb)}}.
The application of the minimal speciﬁcity principle leads to
π = ({aa}, {ab, ba}, {ac, bb, ca}, {bc, cb}, {cc}).
Note that letting π(ac) = π(ca) > π(bb) or the converse
would lead to express more constraints than what is only
speciﬁed by Pareto constraints. In fact, it may look a little
surprising to get π(ac) = π(bb) = π(ca). However this
is justiﬁed by the fact that the minimal speciﬁcity principle
gives to each alternative the highest possible rank (i.e.,
possibility degree). The alternatives ac, bb and ca cannot
have the highest possibility degree since following Pareto
ordering, they are strictly less preferred than aa, ab and ba
respectively. To ensure that we associate the highest pos-
sibility degree to these alternatives, the minimal speciﬁcity
principle keeps the three pairs of evaluations at the same
level, and they are ranked immediately below ab and ba.

The following example extends Example 2 with relative im-
portance constraints:

Example 3 (Example 2 continued)
Suppose that mathematics is more important than literature.
This is translated by the following relative importance con-
straint: π(xy) > π(yx) for x > y. The instantiation of this
constraint provides a new set of constraints:
C (cid:2) = {π(ab) > π(ba), π(ac) > π(ca), π(bc) > π(cb)}.
Let us now apply Algorithm 1 on C ∪ C (cid:2), we get:
π(cid:2) = ({aa}, {ab}, {ba, ac}, {ca, bb}, {bc}, {cb}, {cc}).

An ordering query over two distinct alternatives u1

2 gives a way to answer such queries. The idea is to com-
pute the set of alternatives that are less preferred to u1

ductive closure of this set w.r.t. generic constraints and exam-
ples. If u2

ciple, and C be the set of generic constraints and examples.

the possibilistic counterpart of Pearl’s algorithm for system Z
[Pearl, 1990].

Example 2 Let us consider two subjects “mathematics”
and “literature” that are evaluated on a scale a > b > c
with “a” for good, “b” for medium and “c” for bad. Thus
a student having “ac” is good in mathematics and bad in
literature. Pareto ordering forces to have π(xy) > π(x(cid:2)y(cid:2))
as soon as x > x(cid:2) and y ≥ y(cid:2) or x ≥ x(cid:2) and y > y(cid:2) for
x, y, x(cid:2), y(cid:2) ranging in {a, b, c}. Pareto principle generates
the following set of constraints:
C = {min{π(aa)} > max{π(ab), π(ba), π(ca)},
min{π(aa), π(ab)} > max{π(ac), π(bb), π(bc), π(cb), π(cc)},
min{π(ac), π(ba)} > max{π(bc), π(cc)},
min{π(bb)} > max{π(cb), π(cc), π(bc)},
min{π(ba)} > max{π(ca), π(bb), π(cb)},
min{π(bc), π(cb), π(ca)} > max{π(cc)},

Example 4 (Example 2 continued) Let us compare the alter-
natives ac and cb. We have U1 = {ac} and U2 = {ca}. We
have ca (cid:3)P cb then ac is strictly preferred to cb.
Note that Algorithm 2 returns that ac and bb are incompara-
ble while ac (cid:3) bb w.r.t. Algorithm 1. Indeed, ac is put in the
same stratum as ba (that dominates bb in the sense of Pareto).
This is the effect of minimal speciﬁty principle that puts any
alternatives as high as possible. Thus, using Algorithm 2, one
can distinguish the alternatives that are ranked only by virtue
of the constraints, from those that also require the application
of a default principle (here the minimal speciﬁcity principle)
to be rank-ordered by application of Algorithm 1. Note that if
we are only interested in comparing two alternatives, we may
stop Algorithm 1 as soon as the two alternatives are ranked
(without in general computing the whole pre-order). Note

rithm 2 is consistent with Algorithm 1.

5 Comparison with Choquet integral
In contrast to Choquet integral, which is sensitive to the nu-
merical values of criteria and coefﬁcients of the fuzzy mea-
sure whose adjustment is not obvious, our approach relies on
qualitative values of criteria. This qualitative aspect makes
that the approach is general, i.e. independent of the values of
criteria, which provides more robust results compared to Cho-
quet integral. In fact, constraints over coefﬁcients in a Cho-
quet integral, as well as ranking over speciﬁc alternatives can
be encoded in our framework by means of generic constraints
and examples respectively. Then the application of Algorithm
1 gives a complete pre-order on U which satisﬁes all generic
constraints and examples. In order to make the comparison
precise, we encode each inequality between fuzzy measure
coefﬁcients in terms of relative importance constraints. Re-
call that Choquet integral expression writes:

Cμ(a1 · · · an) = a1 × μX1 + · · · + (an − an−1) × μXn

with Xn ⊂ · · · ⊂ X1 and a1 ≤ · · · ≤ an. Moreover ai is
associated to criterion Xi\Xi+1, Xn+1 = ∅.
Let us consider Example 1, and use a qualitative scale S =
{a, b, c, d, e, f } (with a > b > c > d > e > f )
to encode students’ grades 18, 16, 15, 14, 12 and 10 respec-
tively given in Table 1. Let x, y, z be students’ grades in
mathematics, physics and literature respectively so x, y, z ∈
{a, b, c, d, e, f }. We encode the constraints on μ namely
μM > μL, μP > μL, μM L > μM P , μP L > μM P and
μP = μM by means of generic constraints on π.
i) M is more important than L:

At ﬁrst sight we encode this constraint by:

π(xyz) > π(zyx) for x > z, ∀y.

(4)

However this encoding, apparently natural, is not ad-
equate here since it doesn’t recover the ranking on U
induced by Choquet integral. Let us consider the fol-
lowing alternatives df e, ef d, ead and dae. Following
equation (4) we have π(df e) > π(ef d) and π(dae) >
π(ead). However following Choquet integral we have
Chμ(df e) = 12.7, Chμ(ef d) = 12.4, Chμ(dae) =
14.8 and Chμ(ead) = 15.6. So we have well df e pre-
ferred to ef d but dae is not preferred to ead. This means
that constraint (4) is too weak to encode μM > μL. The
reason is that the constraint μM > μL is more requiry-
ing than what it appears. Thus y should be constrained
rather than to take any value in S.
Let mpl and m(cid:2)p(cid:2)l(cid:2)
Note that
Chμ(mpl) > Chμ(m(cid:2)p(cid:2)l(cid:2)) reduces into μM > μL
when Chμ(mpl) = p + (l − p) ∗ μM L + (m − l) ∗ μM >
Chμ(m(cid:2)p(cid:2)l(cid:2)) = p(cid:2) + (m(cid:2) − p(cid:2)) ∗ μM L + (l(cid:2) − m(cid:2)) ∗ μL.
This supposes p ≤ l < m and p(cid:2) ≤ m(cid:2) < l(cid:2). We put
p = p(cid:2) = y, l = m(cid:2) = z and m = l(cid:2) = x. Thus
μM > μL is encoded in our framework by:

two vectors.

π(xyz) > π(zyx) for x > z ≥ y.

(5)

ii) P is more important than L:

The same reasoning can be made for μP > μL. It is
encoded by:

π(xyz) > π(xzy) for y > z ≥ x.

(6)

iii) The interaction between M and L is higher than the in-

teraction between P and M :
The inequality μM L > μM P is equivalent to the fol-
lowing inequality between the two Choquet integrals
Chμ(mpl) = p + (l − p) ∗ μM L + (m − l) ∗ μM >
Chμ(m(cid:2)p(cid:2)l(cid:2)) = l(cid:2) + (p(cid:2) − l(cid:2)) ∗ μM P + (m(cid:2) − p(cid:2)) ∗ μM .
This supposes p < l ≤ m and l(cid:2) < p(cid:2) ≤ m(cid:2). Let-
ting p = l(cid:2) = y, l = p(cid:2) = z and m = m(cid:2) = x, then
μM L > μM P is encoded by:

π(xyz) > π(xzy) for x ≥ z > y.

(7)

iv) The interaction between P and L is higher than the in-

teraction between P and M :
Similarily μP L > μM P is encoded by:

π(xyz) > π(zyx) for y ≥ z > x.

v) M and P have the same importance:

π(xyz) = π(yxz) for all x, y, z.

(8)

(9)

vi) As previously said, we suppose that Pareto ordering

holds. Namely

π(xyz) > π(x(cid:2)y(cid:2)z (cid:2))

(10)

for x ≥ x(cid:2), y ≥ y (cid:2), z ≥ z (cid:2), (x > x(cid:2) or y > y (cid:2) or z > z (cid:2)).

vii) Lastly C (cid:3) A (cid:3) B is encoded by:

π(dcc) > π(abf ) > π(f ea)

(11)

In sum we have the following set of generic constraints and

examples:

⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩

C =

π(xyz) > π(zyx)
π(xyz) > π(xzy)
π(xyz) > π(xzy)
π(xyz) > π(zyx)
π(xyz) = π(yxz)
π(xyz) > π(x(cid:2)y(cid:2)z (cid:2))

π(dcc) > π(abf ) > π(f ea)

for x > z ≥ y
for y > z ≥ x
for x ≥ z > y
for y ≥ z > x
for all x, y, z
for x ≥ x(cid:2), y ≥ y(cid:2), z ≥ z (cid:2),
x > x(cid:2) or y > y(cid:2) or z > z (cid:2)

Applying Algorithm 1 on C gives a possibility distribution
with 26 strata π = (E1, · · · , E26) with E1 = {aaa},
E2 = {baa, aba}, E3 = {caa, aca, aab}, · · ·, E26 = {f f f }.
The alternatives dcc, abf and f ea belong to E12, E13 and
E15 respectively. Using Choquet integral we get 77 differ-
ent levels: Chμ(aaa) = 18, Chμ(aba) = Chμ(baa) =
17.8, Chμ(aca) = Chμ(caa) = Chμ(f ea) = 13.6, · · ·,
Chμ(f f f ) = 10. Note also that in our approach, cce be-
longs to E14, i.e. we have C (cid:3) A (cid:3) D (cid:3) B.

This work is based on an idea ﬁrst presented in [Dubois et
al., 2005]. This proposal has been extended in two main di-
rections. First, an algorithm is proposed that directly provides
the ranking between any two alternatives (without having to
compute the whole complete preorder on the set of all the
alternatives). Besides, a comparative discussion on an ex-
ample suggests that the proposed approach may be more ro-
bust, more ﬂexible, and is more transparent to the user (who
can control precisely what is expressed by means of the con-
straints) than an aggregation-based method, which moreover
requires the use of a numerical scale in order to have a sufﬁ-
ciently discriminative scale.

Our approach focussed on the particular case where exam-
ples and generic constraints are consistent together in order
to perform the comparison with the Choquet integral exam-
ple, which is also based on this hypothesis. However we can
deal as well with examples that contradict generic constraints.
An algorithm has been proposed in [Dubois et al., 2005]
where examples are considered as exceptions. This algorithm
computes the complete pre-order associated to generic con-
straints, which is then modiﬁed in order to satisfy the exam-
ples provided that Pareto principle is not violated.

The proposed approach may look a bit similar to a topo-
logical sorting procedure that computes a linear ordering of
the nodes of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). An edge from a
node A to a node B means that A should be strictly preferred
to B. Then several complete strict orders are generated satis-
fying all constraints given in the graph. Using our approach
on such constraints we generate a complete pre-order that is
such that if we would change equalities between alternatives
into strict preferences then we would obtain one of the strict
orders agreeing with the topological sort.

The recent years have seen the development of important
works in Artiﬁcial Intelligence on the representations of pref-
erences (e.g., [Wilson, 2004]). However, they start with a set
of local conditional preferences and apply a ceteris paribus

principle for completing the speciﬁcations. In our case, con-
straints are of a different nature. Indeed they refer to complete
speciﬁcations of alternatives either in a generic way or by re-
ferring to particular situations.

7 Conclusion
Starting from possibility theory as a framework for repre-
senting constraints satisfaction, a qualitative method has been
proposed for building a complete preorder that agrees with a
set of constraints in a qualitative way. The approach is fairly
general, and agrees with the way humans state their prefer-
ences in a granular manner, either in terms of generic rules or
by means of examples. This is an extrapolation task not to be
confused with learning. It would amount to e.g. learn impor-
tance relations between criteria from a sufﬁcient number of
examples of preferences between complete alternatives.

A topic of interest for further research would be to make
a general comparison of the approach with multiple criteria
aggregation techniques such as Choquet or Sugeno integrals,
and to study to what extent it is possible to extract constraints
underlying the way these aggregations handle the assessment
of the relative importance of criteria.
