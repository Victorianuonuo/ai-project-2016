DESIGN  OF  AN  EYE 

1.  INTRODUCTION 

At  present  there  is  an  effort  underway  to 
study  the  problems  of  building  an  eye.  The  long 
t e rm goal is to build  an animal.  Some of the details 
of  this  effort  have  been  described  elsewhere(l); 
the  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  explain  why  this 
effort is considered  worthwhile and  to  focus atten(cid:173)
tion on some of  the  more  interesting  philosophical 
issues. 

principles 

Recent  work  in  frog's  vision  is  used  as  a 
basis 
of 
organization that may  be applicable to  broad  areas 
of  the  nervous  system(2).  This  is  not  an  attempt 
to  develop  a  full-blown  theory  of  the  vertebrate 
nervous  system. 
It  is  rather an attempt  to  capture 
something  of  the  style  of  the  animal  system  in  a 
way  that  may  prove  helpful  in solving  engineering 
problems.  Much  of  that  "style11  is  presented  in 
a  series of  observations  about  variability in nature 
and  the  relation  between  structure  and  function 
in  animal  systems.

Certainly  one  of  the  more  interesting  and 
in  nature  is  the

It  is  often  said  of  things 
in  nature  that  no  two  individuals  are  ever  exactly 
alike;  no  two  snowflakes  are  ever  identical,  and

the 
multifariousness of  nature we are  looking  straight 
into  the  face  of  living  spontaneity"(3).  We  find 
the 
inexplicable  and 
sometimes  aweinspiring partly because this wealth 
of  individual  variation does not  fit into the familiar 
context  of  clockwork-like mechanisms which  have 
become  the  paradigm  for  explanations. 
It  is  not 
immediately  obvious  how  the  outward  behavior  of 
two natural  mechanisms can  be so much alike when 
their  individual  components  are  allowed  to  vary 
over such  a wide range. 
It  is  hoped  that  this  study 
w i ll  help  provide a  context  in  which  we  may  begin 
to  find  answers  to  some  of  these  problems.  The 
central  problem  here is  to understand  and  explain 
processes  of nature in terms of  mechanisms  whose 
composition 
is  perhaps  not  capable  of  exact 
duplication  even  in  principle. 

2.  WHY  IMITATE  ANIMAL  SYSTEMS? 

In  many  areas  it  is  becoming  increasingly 
clear that we must somehow  learn  how to construct 
systems  in  which  decisions  about  future  events 
need  not  involve  a  total  committment  before  all 
the facts are in.  We certainly cannot send  to  Mars, 
for example,  a conventionally designed vehicle with 
all responses preprogrammed and all its  hardware 
committed  to specifically preconceived  tasks.  We 
simply  do  not  know  enough  about  the  environment 
to  know  what  responses  would  be  appropriate  in 
all cases.  The same may be said of  many terrestial 
problems  as  well.  Even  an  office  manager  must 
often order new equipment a  year or  two in advance 
without  being  very  clear  in  detail  about  what  he 
w i ll  be  doing  in  one  or  two  years.  Being  forced 
to  make  a  decision  prematurely  can  have 
disasterous  consequences. 
In  many  areas  then 
we see that we must somehow master  the  technique 
of  building  systems with uncommitted  or  partially 
committted  components,  which  may 
later  be 
refined or modified as more data become available. 
These  problems  of  reliability  and  self-
maintainance,  of  learning,  and  the  constraints  of 
real-time  all

problems  the  animal  nervous  system  must  face

different  functions,  originally  treated  separately, 
may introduce interface  problems that  overburden 
the  system  and  detract

A  systems  designer  who  has  faced  this  problem 
of  ever 
in  conventional 
hardware 
can  appreciate  nature's 
methods  of  integration  in  animal  systems.  This 
concern with the eye then has this ulterior  purpose:

There  are  at  least  three  distinct  senses  in 
which 
as 
"unreliable":  1.  Each component may  be unstable 
or unpredictable and  vary  over  time;  2.  Individual 
components  may  be  stable,  but  the  manufacturing 
process  may  introduce  differences  among  these 
individuals;  3.  A ll  components  may  be  identical 
and  uniformly  bad.  For  the  purposes of  this  study 
we  can  ignore 
last  sense.  Although  it  is 
possible  for  components  to  be  unreliable  in  this 
t h i rd  sense,  it  is  unlikely  that  we  would  find  them 
easy to come by.  This kind of unreliability assumes 
a  kind  of  perverted  mastery  of  quality  control, 
and  it is just  that  quality control  that  we  find  most 
difficult  to  achieve. 

this 

A  realistic  solution  to  the  general  problem 
of  reliability  must  solve  both  the  problem  of  the 
unstable  component  and  the  problem  of  variation 
in several  components designed  for the same  task. 
The  past  attempts  to  solve  the  general  problem 
may  have  been  hindered  by  a  failure  to  keep  both 
of  these  aspects  of  the  problem  in  mind.  Most 
of  the  conventional  reliability  measures,  like  the 
use  of  Hamming  codes  and  redundancy  bits,  are 
directed  at  the  so-called  problem  of  the  "noisy 
channel". 
This  is  just  one  aspect  of  the  more 
general  problem  of 
the  noisy  component.  Our 
experience in  this  area  has  already  made  it  clear 
that  even if  one solves  the component  problem  and 
succeeds  in  making  fairly  reliable  components, 
one  is  s t i ll  faced  with  the  problem  of  the  overall 
reliability  of  the  larger  system.  A ll  other  things 
being equal, the larger the system, the less reliable

concentrate  f i r st  on  the  problem  of  component 
reliability  and  when  we  run  out  of  ideas,  we  turn 
in  desperation 
reliability 
measures  which  for  the  most  part  are  awkward 
and  are  hard  to integrate into  the  system  to  which 
we  have  already  painfully  committed  ourselves. 
We  have  known  for  some  time  that  this  strategy 
is  only  marginally  successful,  but  we  have  not 
abandoned 
it  because  there  has  been  no  clear 
alternative. 

The  conventional  strategy  here

In  view  of  this  one  is  tempted  to  say  that 
the  problem  should  be  approached  f r om  the  other 
end.  Unfortunately,  that  is  easier  said  than  done. 
It  is  not  immediately  obvious  what,  or  where,  the 
"other  end"  is. 
In  a  general  way,  of  course,  the 
suggested  strategy  here  is  to  solve  the  systems-
reliability  problem 
the 
individual components that turn out to  be necessary 
for  the  job.  Perhaps  for  large  systems  at  least

reformulation  of  the  reliability  problem  in  more 
practical  t e r m s. 
Instead  of  asking  how  to  keep  a

How  to  design  machines  in  which  e r r o rs  simply 
go  hand  in  hand  with  hardware  failures;  that  i s, 
how  to  prevent  structural  losses  bringing  about 
a  disproportionate  loss  of  function. 

This  should  give  rise 

The  work  of  Lettvin,  Maturana,  McCulloch, 
and  Pitts is  enormously  important  in  this  regard, 
because  it  is  one  of  the  f i r st  serious  attempts  to 
explain  the  function  of  the  frog's  retina  in  terms 
of  the shape and structure of retinal  ganglion cells. 
If  it  can  be  shown  that  structure  and  function  are 
intimately related, that a specific  function  depends 
on  a  specific  shape,  then  one  can  begin  to  see  in

a  general  way at  least  how it might  be  that  a small 
deterioration 
in  structure  brings  about  only  a 
proportionally  small  deterioration  of  function.

of  the  design  of  the  eye  reduces  then  largely  to 
the  problem  of  assigning  a  plausible  function  to 
each  of  these  three  layers  of  the  retina.  The  key

The  development  of  the  theoretical  context 
in  which  one  may  explain  and 
the 
vertebrate eye as a mechanism w i ll  not  be a simple 
achievement;  certainly  it  w i ll  not  be  a  simple 
extension  of  existing  theory.  Even  a  casual  look

suspicion  that  virtually  everything  runs  contrary 
to  what 
is  now  accepted  as  good  engineering 
practice.  The striking  thing  here is  that  the  layer 
of  photoreceptors,  the  transducers in  the  system, 
is 
farthest  from  the  light  source.  The  image  is 
erected  on the  back  side of  the retina, after  having 
been  filtered  through  literally  a  maze  of  blood 
vessels  and  cell  bodies.  There  is  no  evidence 
that  the  light  interacts  chemically  with  anything 
in the  bipolar or  ganglion  layers,  before it  strikes 
the  photoreceptor  layer.  One  can  almost  imagine 
a  malevolent  deity  who  turned  things  around  and 
put  these  layers in front of  the  photoreceptors just 
to  deteriorate  the  image,  scatter  the  light,  and 
confound  our  attempt  to  understand  how  it  works.

The 
philosopher, feeling  the frustration of  dealing  with 
the practical man, rationalizes:  "It  takes all  kinds 
to  make  a  w o r l d ".  Here  we  are  talking  about  an 
analogous  situation  in  which  it  may  be  said  that 
"It  takes  all  kinds  to  make  a  reliable  machine". 
The importance of  this  passing  reference to social 
models  can  be  appreciated  more  fully  when  we 
begin  to  look  at  some  possible  designs. 
In  our 
development  of  these  designs  we  have  taken  the 
social  model  seriously,  and  have  more  or  less 
consciously tried  to  picture a mechanism in  terms 
of  "societies"  of 
individual  computers,  voting 
mechanisms,  societies  of  peers,  the  judgment  of 
experts, and  so on.  Social  models  are  instructive 
because  they seem  to  be examples  of  mechanisms 
which  somehow  rely  on  individual  variation,  and 
which have the same sort of  loose coupling  between 
individuals  and  the  same  kind  of  many-to-many 
connections  that  one  finds  in  the  nervous  system. 
This  approach  to  machine  reliability  is  of 
the  conventional 
course  in  marked  contrast 
approaches. 
In  fact,  it  may  even  be  said  that  we 
are  introducing  a  new  concept  of  Machine'.  The 
traditional  concept  of  a machine is  linked  with  the 
notion of  a  mechanism  with  precisely  describable 
components;  all  the gear teeth  have to be  precisely 
matched  to  be  able  to  mesh.  There  is  no  room 
for  individuality of  parts.  The traditional approach

lays out  his  plan  on  paper;  when  he  makes  a  part, 
he  knows  exactly  what  he  wants. 
If  he  fails  to, 
he  throws  it  away,  tries  again  until  he  succeeds 
in making something  that satisfies the plan exactly. 
Nature on the other  hand  rarely rejects any system 
component,  even  though  many  of  the  components 
appear  to  be  "stamped  out  f r om  a  very  inexact 
and  flexible  mold". 
It  is  as  though  nature  f i r st 
made the components and  then  later  looked  around 
to see how to use them. 
If  one accepts the challenge 
of nature and attempts to design and  build a reliable 
machine  from unreliable components, one  is  doing 
violence  to  the  traditional  concept  of  a  machine, 
especially  if  factors 
like  noise  and  unreliability 
become explicit  components of  design  and  appear, 
as  it  were,  on  the  blueprints.

This  study is  certainly not  the f i r st  to violate 
the  traditional  concept  of  a  machine,  although  not 
as  many  have  covered  this  ground  as  one  might 
think.  Nearly  every  philosopher  since  Descartes 
has  considered 
the  possibility  of  mechanizing 
thought  processes  and  building  automata,  but  this 
typically  has  amounted  to  a  reduction  of  thought 
processes  to machine  processes. 
In  other  words, 
this  has  been  a  redefinition  of  'thought',  rather 
than  a  redefinition  of  'machine1.  The  f i r st  time 
the  traditional  concept  of  a  machine  was  violated 
was  when  someone 
it  would  be  nice  if 
machines  could  detect  and  correct  their  own  er(cid:173)

has made it possible for components to be "inexact" 
and  noisy.  McCulloch  and  Pitts  made  a  real 
advance when they described a network of threshold 
elements  which  compute  the  same  function  under

But  this  is  surely  a  misleading  description. 
It 
is not  in  general  obvious  that  all  problems,  which 
are now solved  in a serial  fashion,  could  be  solved 
faster in a parallel  fashion.  (It would  be something 
like  expecting  two  ships to cross the Atlantic faster

be solved  in a  parallel  way  must  be  representable

computations  some  terms  have  to  be  computed 
before others.  For  example,  it  is  well  known  that 
in  computations  involving  both  multiplication  and 
addition,  (e.g.,  ab±c)  the  order  of  computation  is 
important.  However, the  problem appears in many 
other  areas  as  well.  Many  pattern  recognition 
problems involve  the recognition  of  entities  which 
are  highly  context  dependent,  as  for  example  in 
the  translation  of  natural  languages.  Here  it  is 
important  to establish  the  context  before  deciding

some  computations  are  essentially  serial. 
In 
general  there  w i ll  always  be  some  computations 
which cannot  be reduced  to corresponding  parallel 
computations. 

The order in which  the  layers of  the  nervous 
system are arranged  is  undoubtedly  related  to  the 
essentially serial  aspects of  the computations  that 
the nervous  sytems  is  designed  to  perform.  Part 
of  our task  is  to explore  this  fast-feedback  aspect 
of  layered  computation  as  a  possible  method  of 
achieving  fine  control. 

If  it  is  true  that  the  layered  structure  of 
the  nervous  system  has  something  to  do  with  the 
distribution of  feedback, then one might expect  that 
the kinds of computation performed in a given  layer 
would  all  be  similar,  so  that  information  which 
was fed  back  to a  given  layer would  be appropriate 
to  anything  that  might  be  going  on  in  that  layer. 
It  would  also  satisfy  our  sense  of  economy  if  it 
turned  out  that  neurons  within  a  given  layer  were 
all  simple  variations  on  a  single  theme;  it  would 
explain  how  variations  could  be  rich  with  a 
relatively  simple  genetic  code.  There  is  some 
reason  to  believe  this  may  be  the  case.

that  makes  simple  precise 
analytic  models  of  each  of  the  types  of  neurons 
an  almost  pointless  endeavor.  A  good  model  of 
the  frog's  retina  needs  to  show  something  like  a 
family relationship  between  the  various  types  and 
to  exhibit  the  ways  in  which  these  intermediates 
are something  like a  variation  on  a  simple  theme. 
Four of  the functions performed  in the frog!s 
retina  are  normally  characterized  as  edge 
detection,  moving  convex  edge  detection  (i.e., 
bugs), event  detection, and  dimming; there is some 
question  about  the  function  performed  by  the  fifth 
kind,  because  they  are  so  rare  that  only  a  few 
have  been  studied.  On  the  face  of  it,  it  may  not 
seem as  though  edge  detection and  event  detection 
are  variations  on  a  single  theme,  or  even  have 
anything  at  all  in  common.  To  understand 
the 
family 
these  apparently 
diverse  functions one  needs  to  consider  detectors 
of  this  sort  from  the  stand  point  of  the  logical 
function  they  compute.  F r om  this  point  of  view 
one sees  that  to  detect  an  edge  visually  one  needs 
to compute a difference in  light intensity over  some 
special  area. 
In the simplest case, this is achieved 
with  a  Boolean  'exclusive  or'  element  with  two

input  sin  different  parts  of  the  visual  field.  If 
one  input  is  on  and  the  other  off,  we  know  there 
is a visual  edge or  gradient  between the two inputs. 
An  event  on  the  other  hand  involves  a  difference 
over 
In  this  case  an 
exclusive-or element  with  two inputs  coming  f r om 
the  same  area  of  the  visual 
field,  but  a  delay 
introduced  in  one  of 
the  inputs,  would  compute 
change over  time.  This  shows  that  edge  detection 
and  event  detection  are  related  in  the  sense  that 
both  involve  a  difference  detector.  Now  consider 
what  would  happen 
if  we  made  a  number  of 
exclusive-or  elements  and  allowed  differences  of 
delay in  the  two inputs.  Those elements with  large 
delays in one  input  would  respond  to  slow  changes 
in  the  visual  field;  and  those  with  short  delays 
would  detect  relatively  rapid  changes.  Suppose 
further  that  we  allowed 
the  position  of  the  two 
inputs  to  vary,  so  that  some  pairs  of  inputs  came 
from widely  different  areas in  the  visual  field  and 
some came f r om relatively close areas.  Relatively 
sharp  edges  (steep  gradients  in  light  intensity) 
would  be  detected  by  elements  whose  inputs  were 
close  together,  and  less  distinct  edges  would  be 
detected  by 
farther  apart. 
Elements  whose  inputs  were  close  together  but 
with  slightly  different  delays  would  detect  either 
very sharp  edges or slight  movement.

size  of  the  fields  is  diminished,  the  section  of  a

distinguishable  from a straight  line.  The  control(cid:173)

Helmholz  speaks  of,  and  the  fact  that  light  has  to

kind  of  uneven,  or  "wiggly"  edge  whose  small 
convexities are  detectable  by a  small  convex  edge 
detector;  so  that  what  we  call  an  edge  detector 
is actually a small  convex edge  detector.  A  larger

In  high-fidelity  sound 
reproduction,  for  example,  it  is  well-known  that 
a  number  of  inexpensive  and  even  poorly-made 
speakers, connected  together  in  a  series-parallel 
network, w i ll  often  produce a satisfactory  system. 
Furthermore,  it is often pointed out that  the  system 
is  ever  so  much  better  when  the  speakers  come 
from  different  manufacturers;  the  point  here,  of 
course,  is  that  we  do  not  want  all  the  speakers 
to  have  the  same  peak  in  their  response  curves, 
say  at  100  cps. 
It  is  obvious  that  the  wider  the

of 
forming  a  crossover  network  in  the  series-
parallel  network  of  speakers  mentioned  above  to 
overcome  the  defects  in  transient  response  and 
inefficiency. 

The  peer  group is  the vehicle of  the expert's 
influence.  For example,  expert  lawyers  influence 
only other  lawyers, not  plumbers or  doctors.  The 
expert  plays  a  crucial 
in  any  voting 
mechanism.  He  helps  swing  the  bias  the  right 
way  in  close  elections,  because  he  can  influence 
peers without  being  influenced  by  them.  Although 
we  state these principles in distinctly social terms, 
our  claim  is  that  that  we  can  describe  a  simple 
mechanism  in  which  each  of  these  social  terms 
makes  sense  in  a  relevant  and  non-trivial  way.

Consider the device in  figure  1.  This  device

Now  let  us consider a network  of  these  units 
in  which  several  different  Boolean  functions  are 
computed.  Some  w i ll  have  outputs  only  when  both 
inputs  are  active;  some  w i ll  have  outputs  when 
either  input  is  active. 
Initially  every  element  is 
connected  to  every  other  element  through  chain 
of  association  elements  whose  initial  resistance 
is  zero  ohms.  Every  output  is  a  positive  voltage.

If  two  neighbors  fire  together,

The  formation  of  peergroups  in  the  above 
sense is really only  half  the  battle.  The  intercon(cid:173)
nections  between 
the  various  members  of  a 
peergroup constitute the channel of  communication 
between  the  members.  The  whole  point  of  that 
channel  is  that  the  more  reliable  components  can 
be  allowed  to  "communicate"  with,  and  somehow 
offset  the effects of,  the  less reliable  components. 
We  now  have  to  say  something  about  the  way  in 
which  the  more  reliable  components  can  be  given 
additional  weight.

that  one's  quality

be  desired.  Within  each  peergroup,  some  logic 
units  w i ll  naturally  be  better  than  others.  This 
raises  two  important  problems:  1.  What  does  it 
mean  to  be  "better",  or  to  be  an  "expert"?  and 
2.  How  does  the  mechanism  recognize  one?  The 
f i r st  is  easier  to  answer  than  the  second.

I  do  not  think  the  second  can  be  answered  at  all

in any general answer, and  there is just no adequate 
general  criterion  for  truth.

this  is  what 

An  expert  is  one  who  influences  his  peers, 
but is not influenced  by  them.  F r om  the standpoint 
of  our  model,  we  call  a  unit  an  "expert11  if  the 
horizontal  association  elements  around  it  form 
some  non-linear  element,  like  a  diode. 
In  terms 
of  our  model, 
it  means  to  be  an 
"expert".  The  problem  of  the  c r i t e r ia  by  which 
the  mechanism  is  to  decide  which  elements  are 
to  become  surrounded  by 
fairly 
complicated.  The specific c r i t e r ia for "expertise  ' 
w i ll  probably vary radically with  the  specific  task. 
In any case the specific c r i t e r ia are less important, 
at this  point at  least, if  we can say something  about 
the  manner  in  which  they  are  applied;  and  this 
we  can  do  in  a  general  way. 

The  f i r st  thoughts  on  how  "experts"  might 
be  recognized  arose  out  of  a  consideration  of  the 
difficulties  encountered  in  a  series  of  attempts, 
by  various  members  of  the  biology  department  at 
M.I.T.,  to  make  reliable  recordings  of  neurons

Largely  because  of  the  work

"..  .  The mouse, which  does  not  turn  its  eyes 
and  keeps  them  open,  is  another  nice  animal  to 
work  on.  His  retina  is  the  same  all  over,  and 
whether  you  get  a  response  f r om  a  particular 
ganglion  cell  or  f r om  a  particular  axon  depends 
upon  whether  the  mouse  is  hungry  or  whether  it 
has  smelled  its  cheese. 
If  it  has,  then  it  bothers 
to  look,  but  it  w i ll  not  look  the  rest  of  the  time. 
The mouse  shows very  little  response  to any visual 
stimulus. 
The  situation  is  far  too  complicated 
to  be  solved  with  a  set  of  electrodes"(9). 

The striking  thing  here is  that  one  sense  modality 
(e.g., olfaction) may regulate another (e.g., vision). 
It  suggests  that  neurons  reporting  the  presence 
of  an  object  have  their  output  rates  increased  or 
decreased  according  to  whether  or  not  the  object 
is  reported  by  more  than  one  sense.  That  is, 
neurons  identified  with  objects  that  are  both  seen 
and  heard,  or  seen  and  smelled,  tend  to  be  those 
that  are  in  some  more  " r e a l ",  and  so  there  are

It  seems  then  that  in a certain  sense  we  are 
linking  our  method  of  expert-recognition  with  a 
kind  of  "coherence  theory  of  truth  .  When  two 
different  channels  agree  on  the  presence  of  an 
object, the gain on those neurons agreeing  is turned 
up. 
If  in  the  act  of  modifying  the  gain  on  those 
few neurons,  a  diode  (or  some  similar  non-linear 
device) 
those  neurons,  our 
mechanism is complete.  This is a  general  account 
of  the method we  propose to  pursue.  It s t i ll  leaves 
a  lot  unanswered.  For  example,  the  way  in  which 
it is  decided  whether  two sense modalities "agree" 
is  not  at  all  a  t r i v i al  matter.  One  can  easily  see 
why  the  c r i t e r ia  for  the  coherence  of  inputs  has 
to  be  handled  in  terms  of  the  specific  inputs. 
It 
is one  thing  to see  that  the results  of  two  different 
methods  of  computation  agree,  and  quite  another 
to  see  that  two  different  forms  of  input  somehow 
match. 
It  could  be  a  little  like  trying  to  match 
two  person's  automobiles  and  wardrobes  on  the 
basis  of  theories  about  underlying  personalities.

At  this  point  we  w i ll  assume  that  somehow,  the

or  the more reliable components.  Figure  3  shows 
how  a  peergroup  might  be  expected  to  improve

The  most  publicised  effort

is 
structurally the  simplest of all the learning devices 
proposed  thus  far.  The  unfortunate  thing  about 
the  perceptron is that it is not  immediately  obvious 
that  it  works.  We  need  a  proof  to  convince  us 
that  this  process  of  threshold  modification  in  a 
randomly  connected  network  actually  converges 
on anything.  The  present  suspicion  is  that  it  does 
not, at  least in the interesting cases. 

in 
The  perceptron 

The  peer  group  model  proposed  here  is  too 
structured  a mechanism  to count  as  a  perceptron, 
at least in the ordinary sense.  While the perceptron 
is  an  attempt  to  answer  the  question,  how  much 
function  is  possible  with  how  little  structure,  the 
peer  group  mechanism  is  an  attempt  to  face  the 
problem  of  how  to  find  a  middle  ground  between 
a  conventional  highly  structed  but  unreliable 
machine  and  a  relatively  structureless  machine 

which  finesses  the  quality  control  problem. 
It  is 
clear  that  we  know  how  to  achieve  good  quality 
control  in some  things, and  it  is  important  to  take 
advantage of  that  asset  when we can.  On  the  other 
hand,  it  is clear  that  sometimes we cannot  achieve 
the  quality  control  that  we  might  like,  and  here 
it  is  important  to  learn  how  to  take  advantage  of 
the  other  side  of  the  coin  as  well.

is  clearly  not 
convergent  since  the  process  passes  through,  but 
does  not  necessarily  stop  at,  the  desired  point.) 
Rather  we  need  a  demonstration  that  the  learning 
process  does not  rapidly  deteriorate into  an  aging 
process.  Modifications  in  the  network  are  made 
only  by  breaking  connections,  not  by  making  new 
ones.  This  breaking  of  connections  is  the  basic 
mechanism  for  dividing  groups  of  similar  logic 
units into  peer  groups. 
It  is easy  to  see  that  after 
a  long  period  of  time  the connections  between  two 
units,  which  are  very  similar 
they  may 
compute  the  same  logical  function  but  have  dif(cid:173)
ferent thresholds), and  which should  be in the same 
peer  group,  finally w i ll  be  broken.

the  association  elements 
between  them w i ll  have  deteriorated.  This  shows 
that  the  process  as  we  have  outlined  it  has  an 
inherent aging  problem.  After the initial formation 
of  the  peer  groups,  the  groups  w i ll  continue  to 
divide and  get smaller.  When the  groups  get small 
enough  to  reduce  the  probability  of  there  being 
an  expert  within  each  group,  then  it  is  obvious 
that  the  system  w i ll  begin  to  f a i l.

There  are  several  obvious  ways  in  which 
this aging  problem could  be  overcome,  or  at  least

if  new  horizontal 
association  elements  could  be  made  to  grow  and 
replace  those  that  had  deteriorated,  it  is  easy  to 
see  how  peer  groups  would  become  more  stable. 
In  fact  the animal  may  do  just  this. 
If  we  identify 
these association elements with  horizontal or  glial

However,  glial  cells  are  not  neurons;  they  are 
structural cells which  help  hold a  layer of  neurons

regenerated. 
In  the  past  it  was  hard  to  fit  these 
glial  cells into  a  convincing  theory  of  the  nervous 
system  because, as  glial  cells,  they are  incapable 
of  performing  any  of  the  interesting  tasks  which 
we can attribute  to neurons.  As  passive  elements,

Some  computer  studies  of  the  peer  group

The  results  indicate  that  this  sort  of

something  about  an  unkown  environment  by 
determining  which  of

ways.  What  was  particularly  interesting  in  these
