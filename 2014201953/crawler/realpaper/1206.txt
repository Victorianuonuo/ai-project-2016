ing  down  implausible  t r a i l s, 
I  decided  to 
escalate  one  more  l e v e l. 
Instead  of  hold(cid:173)
ing  decisions  o ff  u n t il  needed,  hold  them 
o ff  even  longer,  making  pseudo  (symbolic) 
decisions  and  continuing.  Ultimately, 
each  pseudo  (symbolic)  decision  in  turn  is 
converted  to  a  real  decision  in  a  Back(cid:173)
track  Programming  algorithm  and  the  re(cid:173)
sults  of  such  decision  can  be  observed. 
We  thus  have  provided  a  means  of  look-
ahead.  The  results  of  a  decision  can  be 
observed  at  the  time  of  that  decision,  and 
so, 
large  portions  of  the 
search  space  could  be  pruned  e a r l i e r. 

I  thought, 

This  method  started  a  simulation  of 

the  F i r i ng  Squad;  b u t,  as  an  undefined 
production  is  encountered,  rather  than 
decide  what  state  should  be  produced,  a 
new  symbolic  state  is  created,  and  the 
simulation  continues  u n t il  a  suitably 
large  structure  has  been  b u i lt  up.  Then, 
via  a  Backtrack  Programming  algorithm 
symbolic  states  are  converted  to  actual 
states.  With  each  such  assignment,  we 
f i r st  check  to  see  if  a  contradiction  has 
occurred.  The  only  kind  of  contradiction 
that  can  occur  in  this  approach  is  two 
productions 
that  have  equal  left-hand 
sides  but  unequal  right-hand  sides.  Such 
contradictions  cause  backtracking  to 
occur.  Second,  finding  no  contradiction, 
the  implications  of  the  assignment  are 
handled.  These  implications  occur  when 
two  productions  exist  w i th  equal 
l e f t-
hand  sides  but  with  at  least  one  r i g h t-
hand  side  s t i ll  symbolic.  To  avoid  a

idea  of  image  states 
respondence  between  states  w i t h in  image

breakthrough,  which  I  now  consider  basic 
to  any  h e u r i s t ic  search  for  a  s o l u t i o n, 
arose  not  through  any  actual  man-machine 
i n t e r a c t i on  but  through  a  man-machine 
symbiotic  relationship  in  which  the  need 
to  communicate  a  complex  feature  of  a 
plan  occurred; 
the  machine  acted 
only  as  a  c a t a l y s t,  not  taking  any  active 
role 

This  viewpoint  also  led  to  the

The 

i n t e r a c t i on  for  this  approach 

it  was  p e r i o d i c a l ly  p r i n t e d, 

involved  observing  on-line  the  simulation 
behavior  as 
and  deciding  whether  or  not  to  l et  the 
program  proceed. 
If  the  decision  were 
made  to  stop  the  simulation,  a  new  input 
specification  of  the  plan  had  to  be  pre(cid:173)
pared  before  r e s t a r t i ng  the  program. 
It 
usually  took  between  10  to  20  minutes  to 
decide  what  modifications 
to  make  to  the 
plan  s p e c i f i c a t i o n,  and  about  one  minute 
to  a c t u a l ly  make  them  and  r e s t a rt  the 
program.  The  environment  under  which  this 
was  performed  was  a  non-multiprogrammed 
batch  machine  for  which  I  was 
the  sole 
user  during  my  signup  periods.  Thus, 
although  I  was  running  in  a  standard 
batch  o f f - l i ne  environment, 
on-line  w i th  the  program  w i th  an  e f f e c t i ve 
response  time  of  one  minute. 

I  was  r e a l ly 

We  frequently  t a lk  about  the  response

about  the  human  response  time,  except 
for  such  t r i v ia  as  the  time  to  h it  a  key. 
In  the  above  man-machine  system,  my  re(cid:173)
sponse  time  was  over  an  order  of  magni(cid:173)

thus  I 
did  not  f e e l,  during  my  work,  that  the 
machine  was  not  adequately  handling  i ts 
portion  of  our  partnership. 
it  is  hard  to  see  how  the  machine, 
for 
t h is  approach,  could  have  further  aided 
me  to  cut  down  my  response  time. 
I  was 
s t i ll  performing  too  much  work  in  our 
partnership;  work  for  which  my  processing 
c a p a b i l i t i es  were  not  w e ll  suited.

CONSTRAINT  SATISFACTION 

The  last  attempt  at  finding  a  solu(cid:173)

tered  in  Functional  Planning;  mainly 
that  I  was  s t i ll  supporting  too  much  of 
the  load  in  terms  of  real  e f f o rt  expended 
per  i t e r a t i o n. 
I  t r i ed  to  f i nd  a  way  of 
specifying  a  plan  that  was  more  natural 
to  the  way  I  was  conceptualizing  the 
problem. 

My  basic  representation  was  the  two

ray  plan  followed  the  kinds  of  ideas  ex(cid:173)
pressed  in  the  section,  "General  Outline

I  wanted  an 
easy  way  of  communicating  this  to  the  ma(cid:173)

a  simulation  and,  by  observing  i ts  beha(cid:173)

I  decided  to  specify  i ts 
behavior  in  the  same  way--the  medium  is 
the  message.  That  i s,
