In  order  to  measure  the  3-dimensional

position  directly,  a  range  finder  has 
been  studied,  and  two  typical  methods 
have  been  developed  up  to  now.  One  is  to 
project  a  spot  light  and  detect  i ts 
reflecting  l i g h t, 
based  on  the  stereoscopic  view. 
former  takes  a  long  time  to  got  the  range 
of  many  points  of  objects  because  it 
requires  the  rotation  of  a  spot  beam  for 
the  measurement  of  each  point.  The 
latter  requires  a  great  deal  of  calcu(cid:173)
lation  to  determine  the  corresponding 
points  of  the  two  pictures. 

The 

The  method  presented  here  employs  a 

vertical  s l it  projector  and  a  TV  camera 
to  pick  up  its  reflected  light.  By 
rotating  a  projector  from  the  l e ft  to  the 
right,  the  distance  of  many  points  in  a 
field  of  view  is  obtained  quickly. 

2.  Construction  of  a  range  finder 

The  range  finder  employed  in  this 
study  projects  a  light  beam  through  a 
vertical  s l it  in  a  projector  at  a  constant 
distance  from  a  TV  camera  as  shown  in 
F i g . l.

pictures  are  sampled  by  a  TV  camera  at 
predetermined  instances  and  the  infor(cid:173)
mation  related  to  each  picture  and  a 
corresponding  s l it  beam  angle  is  stored. 
If  each  position  of  a  s l it  in  the  picture 
is  determined  from  a  stored  picture,  then 
its  3-dimensional  position  can  be  calcu(cid:173)
lated  by  means  of  trigonometry.  The 
input  of  picture  data  is  controlled  by  a 
computer  as  shown  in  Fig.2,  and  the  video 
signal  of  each  picturee  is  converted  into 
a  digital  signal  by  a  preprocessor. 
This  preprocessor  divides  the  frame  of  a 
camera  into  256  x  256  picture  elements,

and  its  position  is  established  as  the 
center  of  the  sequence.  This  operation  is 
carried  out  for  every  j,  and  then  a  s l it 
position  is  denoted  by  the  sequence  of 
points  I ( j ).  Fig.4

step  for  composition  of  lines  from  the 
sequence  of  s l it  points  I ( j ),  discon(cid:173)
tinuous  points  are  found  and  each  set  of 
l ( j)  whose  elements  are  regarded  as 
continuous  is  listed.  A  set  of  s l it 
points  {T(j),  J=J s~ Je} constitutes  a  line 
or  several  adjacent  lines.  The  next  step 
i s,  therefore,  to  find  the  number  of  lines 
included  in  a  set  of  s l it  points,  and  the 
terminal  points  and  the  equation  of  each 
line.  At  f i r st  a  sequence  of  I ( j)  which 
constitutes  a  line  segment  is  found. 
This  sequence  {I ( ji ) ,  Ji= J _3, J _2, j _1Jo, 
J-1'  J2'  J3}  must  satisfy  the  following  two 
equations: 

and  64  x  64  elements  are  sampled  in  one 
scanning  time. 

3.  Recocrmtion  of  polyhedrons 

The  recognition  procedure  of 

In  (l)  -  (3),  only  picture  data 

polyhedrons  based  on  a  set  of  picture  data 
and  s l it  beam  angles  involves  (l)  de(cid:173)

,  (4)  determination  of  the  position  of

hedrons. 
are  used;  in  (4),  the  3-dimensional 
position  of  the  plane  is  obtained  with 
s l it  beam  angles. 
In  (5),  the  objects 
are  recognized  based  on  the  interrelation 
of  planes.  There  is  an  alternative 
process  of  estimating  the  distance  to  the 
surface  for  each  point  and  then  analyzing 
the  two  dimensional  field  of  distance  to 
find  surface.  This  method  takes  a  long 
time  for  calculation  of  the  distance  for 
evely  point.  The  process  presented  here 
calculates  only  the  end  points  of  lines 
to  determine  the  psoition  of  planes. 
Each  procedure  is  described  in  detail  in 
the  f o il owing. 

(1)  Determination  of  s l it  positions 

Each  picture  corresponding  to  a  s l it 
beam  angle  is  stored  in  binary  form  where 
each  picture  element  is  1  if  the  light 
intensity  is  above  the  threshold,  and  0 
otherwise.  At  f i r st  this  picture  is 
smoothed  to  eliminate  the  effect  of  noise 
caused  by  a  vidicon  camera  or  a 
preprocessor.  Let  the  binary  picture 
element  be  denoted  by  the  mutrix  element 
C ( i , j ),  the  output  of  smoothing  operation 
C ' ( i , j)  is  the  majority  of  C ( i , j ),  C(i, 
j - l)  and  C ( i , j + l ).  By  examining  elements 
C ' ( i , j)  along  the  j th  row,  from  among  the 
sequences  whose  element  successively  takes 
value  1,  the  longest  sequence  is  selected,

line  is  found.  This  algorithm  i s,  as 
shown  in  Fig.6,  to  track  the  s l it  point, 
sequentially  correcting  the  equation  of  a 
line.  Fig.7  shows  the  result  of  the 
tracking  and  Fig.8  shows  the  lines  thus 
obtai ned. 

(3)  Composition  of  planes 

If  s l it  images  are  sampled 

This  operation  groups  linos  obtained 
in  (2)  into  classes  whose  element  consti(cid:173)
tutes  a  plane. 
at  constant  time  intervals,  then  the 
images  of  the  slits  projected  on  the  same 
plane  form  nearly  parallel  lines  at 
constant  intervals.  Adjacent  lines  which 
correspond  to  s l it  beam  angles 

are  grouped  into  the  same  class,  and 

then  the  lines  in  a  class  are  again  d i(cid:173)
vided  into  different  classes  based  on 
their  intervals.  After  this  operation, 
each  class  of  lines  constitutes  a  plane. 
The  principle  of  the  above  two  classifi(cid:173)
cation  algorithms  is  about  the  same  as 
that  of  tracking  in  (2);  i.e.,  at  f i r st 
find  the  segment  of  a  plane  and  then 
examine  the  next  line  if  it  belongs  to  the 
plane  until  the  boundary  line  of  the  plane 
is  found. 

(4)  Determination  of  the  positions  of 

planes 
A  class  of  lines  obtained  in  (3)  does 

not  precisely  compose  a  plane  because  of 
errors  in  various  phases  of  the  procedure. 
In  this  stage,  the  3-dimensional  position 
of  each  plane  is  calculated  from  the  class 
of  lines  and  their  corresponding  s l it  beam 
angles.  Let  a  plane  consist  of  n  lines 
and  the  equation  of  the  plane  be  denoted 
by  bx  +  c  =  0.  Let  L(x.,  b,  c)  denote 
the  Euclidian  distance  between  the  plane 
and  a  point  x.  on  the  i th  line,  then 
L ( xi,  b,  c)  can  be  easily  calculated. 
Let  the  integral  of L2 (x.,  b,  c)  be 
defined  as 

(3) 

The  coefficients  of  the  equation  of  the 
plane,  b  and  c,  are  determined  by  the 
least  squares  method  so  that  the  follow(cid:173)
ing  value  J  is  minimized.

(5)  Composition  of  polyhedrons 

In  this  process,  the  objects  are 

recognized  and  their  parameters  are 
measured  from  the  shape  and  the  position 
of  the  planes.  Although  this  algorithm 
depends  on  the  purpose  of  the  particular 
recognition,  an  example  of  finding  the 
shape,  size  and  position  of  polyhedrons 
is  described  here.  First,  the  background 
planes  are  eliminated  from  the  l i st  of  the 
obtained  planes.  The  vertical  planes  are 
picked  up  from  the  rest  of  the  planes  and 
their  geometrical  relation  is  examined. 
Next,  the  horizontal  planes  on  the 
vertical  ones  are  found. 
plane  is  found,  the  shape  of  the  poly(cid:173)
hedron  is  recognized  according  to  the 
shape  of  the  horizontal  plane  and  the 
If  it  is  not 
adjacent  vertical  planes. 
found,  the  shape  of  the  polyhedron  is 
estimated  from  the  vertical  planes  only. 
Once  the  shape  of  the  polyhedron  is 
determined,  i ts  size  and  position  is 
obtained  easily  because  the  shape  and 
position  of  a ll  the  surface  planes  of  the 
polyhedron  are  known.  The  result  of  the 
recognition  is  illustrated  in  Fig.9. 

If  a  horizontal 

This  recognition  procedure  has  low 
sensitivity  to  noise  because  it  utilizes 
3-dimensional  information.  The  s l it 
image,  for  example,  may  be  broadened 
according  to  the  direction  of  planes.
