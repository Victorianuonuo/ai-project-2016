in  one  domain  than  in  the  other.  For  example, 
cal  properties,  Buch  as  the  shape  of  a  texture  element, 
are  grumbled  in  the  Fourier  domain  while  they  are  pre­
served  in  the  Bpatial  domain;  a  similar  s i t u a t i on  ex-
i g ts  in  the  Bpatial  s h i ft  among  elements.  On  the  other 
hand, 
the  global  organization  of  texture  elements  is 
expressed  more  succinctly  in  the  Fourier  domain  than 
in  the  s p a t i al  domain.  We  shall  describe  below  the 
procedures  of 
feature  extraction  in  each  respective 
domain. 

Texture  descriptors  derived  in  the  s p a t i al  domain 

procedures  i s o l a t i ng  the  image 

Since  descriptors  refer  to  properties  of  objects 
it 

(texture  elements)  represented  in  the  image  space, 
is  natural  to  look  for  operators  acting  d i r e c t ly  in 
the  s p a t i al  domain.  Several  low  level  operators  have 
to  be  combined  i n to  a  procedure  to  obtain  the  desired 
texture  description.  A  skeleton  of  such  a  process  u-
sually  consists  of: 
elements,  geometric  description  of  image  elements,  and 
clustering  of  elements  based  on  proximity  and  t h e ir 
s p a t i al  organization. 
A  set  of  simple  descriptors 
has  been  suggested  and  implemented  by  Rosenfeld  and 
Thurston. 
in  p a r a l l e l,  several  local  aver­
aging  operators  applied  in  d i f f e r e nt  directions  and  on

Tn  the  process  of  i s o l a t i ng  the  image  elements 

Here, 

the  most  important  features  are  the  following  topolo­
gical  properties: 
connectivity,  c o n t i n u i t y,  and  prox­
i m i t y.  These  properties,  applied  to  brightness  or 
color,  are  used  in  a ll  region  finders. 
the  a l­
gorithm  is  based  on  grouping  a ll  adjacent  points  with 
similar  brightness  and/or  color.  Discontinuity  is  the 
basic  property  to  be  used  in  edge  and  l i ne  operators.-3 ,6 
Current  edge  and  l i ne  operators  are  designed  for  de­
t e c t i ng  d i s c o n t i n u i t i es  between  two  large  homogeneous 
regions  and  they  do  not  operate  s a t i s f a c t o r i ly  on 
small  regions.  The  textured  elements  that  one  finds 
in  outdoor  scenes  are  too  small  in  size  and  too  large 
in  number  to  be  processed  usefully  by  any  of  the  above 
operators.

a  new  structure  formed  by  the  texture  elements.  Here, 
the  main  problem  is  to  recognize  the  whole  as  composed 
of  texture  elements.  For  example, 
the  dots  could  form 
l i ne  or  a  random  dot  pattern;  straight  lines

In  natural  scenes, 

the  importance  of  descriptors  derived  in  the  s p a t i al 
domain,  we  shall  not  use  them  in  t h is  work  for  the  f o l­
lowing  reason.  Currently  available  edge  finders  and 
region  finders  are  tailored  for  large  homogeneous  r e­
gions. 
textured  areas  are  composed 
of  small  texture  elements.  Even  to  the  extent  that  the 
boundaries  of  s m a ll  regions  are  determined, 
structures  require  unreasonably  large  memory,  since  the 
boundary  descriptions  are  no  longer  economical.  The 
next  steps  -  description  of  elements  and  clustering  e l­
ements  of  similar  d i r e c t i o n,  size,  color,  or  brightness 
-  seem  p r o h i b i t i v e ly  time  consuming  and  d i f f i c u lt

In  t h is  f i g u r e,  the

is  the  resynthesized  texture,  produced  according  to 
the  description.  As  one  can  see  from  these  pictures,

The  texture  names  are  on  the  top  of  each  picture

The  actual  samples  of  texture  -  wood,  canvas,  c i r c l e, 
and  Band  -  are  in  Figures  1,  2,  3,  and  4. 

In  F i g.  5  we  display  a  sample  of  grass.  The  upper

This  example  is  presented  to  demonstrate  the  ne­

The  rationale  for  t h is  is  that  most
