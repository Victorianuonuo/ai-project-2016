ABSTRACT 

class  of  molecules. 

An  information  processing  model  of  some  important 
aspects  of  inductive  reasoning  is  presented  w i t h in  the 
context  of  one  s c i e n t i f ic  d i s c i p l i n e.  Given  a 
c o l l e c t i on  of  experimental  (mass  spectrometry)  data 
from  several  chemical  molecules  the  computer  program 
described  here  separates  the  molecules  i n to  " w e l l-
behaved"  subclasses  and  selects  from  the  space  of  a ll 
explanatory  processes  the  " c h a r a c t e r i s t i c"  processes 
for  each  subclass. 
The  d e f i n i t i o ns  of  "well-behaved" 
and  " c h a r a c t e r i s t i c"  embody  several  heuristics  which 
are  discussed.  Some  results  of  the  program  are 
discussed  which  have  been  useful  to  chemists  and  which 
lend  c r e d i b i l i ty  to  t h is  approach.

THE TASK  AREA 

For  reasons  discussed  previously 

2 
,  the  task  area 
is  mass  spectrometry,  a  branch  of  organic  chemistry. 
The  r u le  formation  task  is  to 
characterize  the  behavior  of  classes  of  molecules 
in 
the  mass  spectrometer,  given  the  mass  spectrometric 
data  from  several  known  molecules. 

f i nd  rules  that 

The  chemical  structure  of  each  molecule  is  known. 

The  data  for  each  molecule  are  a)  the  masses  of 
various  molecular  fragments  produced  from  the  electron 
bombardment  of  the  molecule  in  the  instrument  and 
b) 
the  r e l a t i ve  abundances  of  fragments  at  each  mass. 
The  data  for  each  molecule  are  arranged  in  a  fragment-
mass  table  {FMT),  or  mass  spectrum.  T y p i c a l l y,  there 
are  50-100  data  points  in  one  FMT.  The  task  is  to 
characterize  the  experimental  behavior  of  the  whole

Rules  which  characterize  the  behavior  of  the 

in 

molecules  are  represented  as  conditional  sentences 
our  system.  The  antecedent  of  a  simple  conditional 
rule  is  a  predicate  which  is  true  or 
molecule  (or  class  of  molecules);  the  consequent  is  a 
description  of  a  mass  spectrometric  action  (henceforth 
"process")  which  is  thought  to  occur  when  that  molecule 
is  in  the  experimental  context.  We  have  termed  these 
rules  " s i t u a t i o n - a c t i on  r u l e s"  (or  "S-A  r u l e s " ).  The 
r u le  syntax  has  been  described  previously3  and  is  not 
c r i t i c al  to  an  understanding  of  the  present  paper.

OVERVIEW OF  METHOD 

The  rule  formation  program  contains  three  major 
sub-programs,  which  are  described  below  under  the 
headings  Data  I n t e r p r e t a t i o n,  Process  Selection,  and 
Molecule  Selection.  The  control  structure  for  the 
o v e r a ll  program  is  described  after  the  discussions  of 
the  three  major  sub-programs.  A  b r i ef  overview  of  the 
whole  program  w i ll  be  given  f i r s t,  however, 
in  order  to 
set  the  context.

below.  To  a  large  extent  the  choice  of  these  c r i t e r ia 
and  p a r t i c u l a r ly  the  choice  of  parameter  settings  are 
a r b i t r a r y.  However,  the  following  discussion  provides 
some  rationale  for  our  choices. 

Frequency.

time.  This  is  what  we  would  l i ke  to  mean  by 
a c t e r i s t i c'  process.  However,  the  data  contain  noise 
and,  more  importantly,  we  are  forced  to  interpret  the 
data  in  terms  of  processes  that  we  construct.  Thus, 
in  the  l i t e r a t u re  one  finds  discussions  of  exceptions 
to  rules  together  with  presentation  of  the  r u l e s.  A 
low  frequency  threshold  (60%)  is  used  as  a  c r i t e r i on 
for  plausible  process  instead  of  a  high  one  because  the 
marginal  processes  which  are  included  at  one  step  can 
be  excluded  at  a  l a t er  refinement  step  if  they  prove  to 
be  uncharacteristic  of  a  class  of  molecules. 

Simplicity  (Occam's  Razor), 

If  two  or  more  processes  explain  the  same  data 

p o i n t,  prefer  the  simpler  one, 
involving  feWer  simple  steps.

chemical  molecules  could  also  help  c l a s s i fy  molecules

features  such  as  these  are  not  used  during  molecule

chemists)  on  the  adequacy  of  the  results  of  the

The  o v e r a ll  flow  of  control  has  been  b r i e f ly

The  molecule  selection  program  selects  a  subclass 

of  molecules  S,  from  M'  ,  t h at  ere  best  characterized  by 
the  processes  in  P.  The  subclass  S  includes  molecules 
that  show  evidence  for  most  (85%  or  more)  of  the 
processes  in  P,  and  excludes  molecules  that  are 
exceptions  to  many.  Thus  S  is  at  least  as  w e ll  behaved 
as  M'  with  respect  to  P.  And  since  the  two  measures  of 
selection  are  not  p e r f e c t ly  complementary,  S  is  l i k e ly 
to  be  better  behaved  than  M'  w i th  respect  to  P, 
molecule  selection  uses  less  r e s t r i c t i ve  measures  than 
process  s e l e c t i o n,  then  S  w i ll  be  less  w e ll  behaved 
than  M'  and  the  procedure  w i ll  f a il  except  when  the

The  condition  under  which  we  want  the  program  to

In  other 
words,  under  t h is  condition  the  program  has  found  an  S

the  stopping  conditions  tests  whether  the  refinement 
level  is  equal  to  an  a r b i t r a ry  maximum,  which  is 
currently  3.  This  condition  is  necessary  to  avoid  an 
i n f i n i te  loop  in  the  case  where  the  program  can  f i nd 
no  subclass  S  that  is  homogeneous  w i th  respect  to  P. 
The  l e v el  3  has  been  observed  to  produce  f a i r ly

after  three  i t e r a t i o ns  through

Our  experience  is  very  l i m i t e d.  Because  there  is  no

RESULTS 

The  INTSUM  program  alone  has  already  provided 
useful  new  results  for  chemists,  as  reported  in  the 
chemical  l i t e r a t u re  .  The  process  selection  program, 
working  w i th  output  from  INTSUM  (but  without  molecule 
s e l e c t i o n ),  has  successfully  found  sets  of  character(cid:173)
i s t ic  processes  f or  a  well-understood  class  of 
molecules  (estrogens,  Figure  3)  and  for  classes  whose 
behavior  is  s t i ll  under  i n v e s t i g a t i on  ( e . g ., 
equilenins,  progesterones,  amino  acids).  For  47 
estrogens,  which  were  assumed  by  both  an  expert  and 
the  program  to  be  in  one  class,  rules  found  by  the 
program  agree  closely  w i th  rules  formed  by  the  expert 
from  the  same  data. 
t a b l e,  but  the  comparison  w i th  the  expert's  rules 
looks  much  l i ke  that  shown  in  Table  I.)  Expert 
chemists  have  made  suggestions  for  improvements,  but 
were  generally  in  agreement  w i th  the  processes 
selected  by  the  program.

The  r u le  formation  program  w i th  molecule 

selection  has  been  tested  on  several  sets  of  molecules. 
The  r e s u l ts  of  running  the  program  on  a  set  of  15 
estrogens  (a  subset  of  the  47  mentioned  above)  are 
shown  in  Table  I.  The  program  separated  two  of  the 
15  compounds  i n to  a  second  class  because  they  were  not 
as  well  behaved  as  the  rest  -  they  were  exceptions  to 
about  20%  of  the  c h a r a c t e r i s t ic  processes.  However,

the  chemist  thought  the  separation  was  reasonable.  The 
processes  selected  by  the  program  are  shown  w i th 
indications  of  the  discrepancies  between  the  program's 
choices  and  the  chemist's.  The  discrepancies  mostly 
arose  from  the  program's  applying  d i f f e r e nt  c r i t e r ia 
to  select  one  process

chemist  d id  c l a s s i fy  the  compounds  by  such  features. 
By  selecting  well-behaved  subclasses  of  molecules  the 
program  grouped  four  or  f i ve  "equilenins"  (molecules 
#4,  8,  10,  19)  and  a ll  three  "3-acetates"  {#3,  1 1,  l8)

"gamma-lactone"  (#5).  The  two  molecules  remaining 
unclassified  at  the  end  of  the  procedure  were  the  last

CONCLUSIONS 

Building  an  information  processing  model  of 

s c i e n t i f ic  reasoning  in  mass  spectrometry,  although  not 
completed,  has  already  led  to  i n t e r e s t i ng  and  useful 
r e s u l t s.  The  model  incorporates  h e u r i s t ic  search  in 
process  selection.  The  procedure  for  selecting 
molecules  can  be  thought  of  as  a  planning  procedure 
insofar  as 
for  a  class  of  diverse  molecules  to  a  number  of  smaller 
subproblems,  v i z ., 
classes  of  well-behaved  molecules.  However, 
molecule  selection  procedure  is  highly  dependent  on 
process  s e l e c t i o n,  as  described  in  d e t a i l. 

it  reduces  the  problem  of  formulating  rules 

for  smaller

The  incompleteness  of  the  program  as  a  model  of  the 

e n t i re  r u le  formation  procedure  should  be  readily 
apparent.  We  have  not  described  anything  that 
approximates  confrontation  of  rules  w i th  new  data, 
example.  But  as  the  results  section  i n d i c a t e s,  the 
program  can  separate  subclasses  of  well-behaved 
molecules  and  can  f i nd  characteristic  processes  for  the 
subclasses  w i th  enough  accuracy  (on  a  few  examples)  to 
gain  preliminary  acceptance  by  an  expert  in  the  f i e l d.
