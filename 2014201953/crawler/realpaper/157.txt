Abstract

Multiagent models of the emergence of social con-
ventions have demonstrated that global conventions
can arise from local coordination processes without
a central authority. We further develop and extend
previous work to address how and under what con-
ditions emerging conventions are also socially ef(cid:2)-
cient, i.e. better for all agents than potential alter-
native conventions. We show with computational
experiments that the clustering coef(cid:2)cient of the
networks within which agents interact is an impor-
tant condition for ef(cid:2)ciency. We also develop an
analytical approximation of the simulation model
that sheds some light to the original model be-
havior. Finally, we combine two decision mech-
anisms, local optimization and imitation, to study
the competition between ef(cid:2)cient and attractive ac-
tions. Our main result is that in clustered networks
a society converges to an ef(cid:2)cient convention and
is stable against invasion of sub-optimal conven-
tions under a much larger range of conditions than
in a non-clustered network. On the contrary, in
non-clustered networks the convention (cid:2)nally es-
tablished heavily depends on its initial support.

1 Introduction
Social conventions, according to [Ullmann-Margalit, 1977],
are a special type of norms related to coordination problems,
that is, those regularities of behavior which are a result of
being a solution of a recurrent coordination problem, which
with time, turn normative. The emergence and stabilization
of norms, including social conventions, is one of the fun-
damental problems of social sciences [Bendor and Swistak,
2001]. Intuitively, a social convention might be regarded as
any rule of behavior or a behavioral constraint [Walker and
Wooldridge, 1995]. A convention simpli(cid:2)es people’s deci-
sion making problem by dictating how to act in certain sit-
uations. Therefore, social conventions help to reduce com-
plexity and uncertainty, particularly when the environment is

open and dynamic. From this perspective it is obvious that
mechanisms underlying the emergence of social conventions
are of great interest for Distributed Arti(cid:2)cial Intelligence.

[Shoham and Tennenholtz, 1992] addressed the question
whether and how the emergence of conventions is possible
from decentralized, local interaction, as opposed to conven-
tions designed and enforced a priori by a central authority.
Shoham demonstrated that self-coordination based on a sim-
ple local optimization rule can emerge from initial disorder.
Following Shoham’s, many researchers have studied and im-
proved his seminal work, proposing other strategies rather
than HCR [Walker and Wooldridge, 1995], studying the time
needed before the convention is established [Kittock, 1993],
adding complex interaction patterns among agents [Delgado,
2002], and many others.

However, an important question remains open, when two
potential different conventions exist which one will be es-
tablished at the end? This question is not applicable to the
original work of [Shoham and Tennenholtz, 1992], since the
game was a pure coordination game, where no action pareto-
dominates the other. Nevertheless, the question applies to all
coordination games where one action is more ef(cid:2)cient than
the other. The discussion in social sciences gives no clear
answer to why and under what conditions ef(cid:2)cient conven-
tions may prevail. As [Bendor and Swistak, 2001] point
out, there are at least two con(cid:3)icting positions in sociology,
the strong functionalism thesis and the rational choice view.
Strong functionalism claims that norms and conventions exist
because they are functional for the group, that is, they yield
optimal collective outcomes. According to this perspective,
the system should always end up in an ef(cid:2)cient convention.
However, the functionalist approach has been criticized for its
lack of a microfoundation. Adherents of the rational choice
view on norms argue that individuals adopt norms only when
it serves their self-interest to do so. This includes the pos-
sibility that mechanisms such as social control may stabilize
conventions that are an individually ef(cid:2)cient response to the
given constraints, but are socially inef(cid:2)cient.

In section 2 we describe our model. In section 3 we de-
scribe the experimental results and analyze the necessary con-
ditions to converge to the optimal convention. In section 4 we
analyze the time ef(cid:2)ciency of the emergence of conventions.
In section 5 we integrate and analyze experimentally opti-
mization and imitation partially competing decision mecha-

nisms in the model. Finally, main results are summed up in
section 6.

2 Formal Model
We follow the conceptual framework introduced by [Shoham
and Tennenholtz, 1992], and the extension proposed by [Del-
gado, 2002] that introduced complex networks as the under-
lying topology. .
2.1 The Coordination Game
A set of N agents must choose to play one of two possible ac-
tions: either A or B. Accordingly to its current action, or state,
an agent interact with its neighbors receiving an outcome de-
(cid:2)ned in payoff matrix G.

Agent j

Figure 1: Payoff Matrix of the Game G

The payoff matrix G de(cid:2)nes a 2-person 2-choice symmet-
ric coordination game provided that x > v and y > u.
The condition on the entries of G makes clear that to play
the same action is the best choice.
It is trivial to demon-
strate that the game G has two nash-equilibrium, both agents
playing either A or B. Most previous work focused in the
study of pure coordination games: where x = y = +1,v =
u = (cid:0)1 [Walker and Wooldridge, 1995; Kittock, 1993;
Shoham and Tennenholtz, 1997; Delgado, 2002]. In our ap-
proach we move beyond this work and allow for coordina-
tion games with equilibrium differing in social ef(cid:2)ciency (i.e.
x > y).

For simplicity we assume that coordination on action A is
at least as pro(cid:2)table as coordination on action B: x (cid:21) y.
Thus, game G is de(cid:2)ned as follows: v = u = (cid:0)1, y = +1,
and x = (cid:11) provided that (cid:11) (cid:21) 1. When (cid:11) > 1, coordina-
tion in B is a sub-optimal solution since there exists a pareto-
ef(cid:2)cient solution that pareto-dominates B, which is, coordi-
nation in action A.

2.2 Action Selection Rule and Dynamics
Our MAS is composed of N agents that interact only with its
neighbors in the social network, playing the game G once per
interaction. Every agent, say the kth, has memory Mk that
records the M last interactions of agent k. The value of the
k; tii, where
position i of the memory Mk is the tuple hai
k stands for the action played by k, pi
k stands for the payoff
ai
received after playing action ai
k, and ti denotes the time the
interaction took place. The initial action of the agents is set
randomly with a probability rB, which is the density of agents
playing action B in the beginning.

Following [Shoham and Tennenholtz, 1992] we will use
the Highest Cumulative Reward (HCR) action selection rule.
Intuitively HCR says:
if the accumulated payoff obtained
from playing A is bigger than that from playing B then keep
on A, otherwise change to action B. The HCR rule is very

k; pi

appropriate since it provides: 1) Locality: the selection func-
tion only depends on the agent’s personal history. No global
knowledge of the system is required, not even the payoff ma-
trix of the game. 2) Adaptability: the agent learns from its
experience without assuming cognitive capabilities. These
characteristics are very important in MAS.

S = Pi:ai

The dynamics of the system are as follows. At each time
step t, an agent k is randomly activated. Once the agent is
activated, it plays the game G with an agent randomly cho-
sen from k’s neighborhood, say agent l. The result of the
interaction is stored into agent k’s memory Mk, removing
the oldest entry if necessary. Finally, agent k must decide
whether to change its action or not. To do so it uses the
Highest Cumulative Reward rule. Agent k will compute the
payoff received for using action S on the last M activations:
k, where S = fAjBg. Agent k will switch
P k
k=S pi
to action S if P k
S . Agent l also carries out the mem-

ory storage and the action updating while the rest of agents
remain still. The system ends once all agents play either ac-
tion A or B, which means, that a convention on either A or
B have been established.
2.3 Underlying Topology
To model qualitatively different interaction structures, we
use several graph models that recently have been shown to
have profoundly different effects on cooperation and diffu-
sion dynamics in MAS [Watts and Strogatz, 1998; Albert and
Barab·asi, 2002; Delgado, 2002]. The chosen graphs are: a)
Random graphs: Rhki
N , where N is the number of nodes, and
hki is the average connectivity, that is, the average size of
node’s neighborhood. Random graphs have a clustering co-
ef(cid:2)cient that tends to zero. The average path length grows
logarithmically in function of N, the number of nodes. b)
N , regular graphs display an extremely
Regular graphs: C k
high clustering coef(cid:2)cient, while its average path length and
diameter grows linearly. Which means, for big graphs the
average path length is very long, which does not agree with
empirically studied networks. However, regular graphs dis-
play the close-knit property due to its high clustering coef-
(cid:2)cient, which does agree with empirical studies. c) Small-
world graphs: W hki;p
, these are highly-clustered graphs (like
regular graphs) with small average path length (like random
graphs). This is the small-world property. We chose the
[Watts and Strogatz, 1998] model as model of small-world
graphs, where p is the rewiring probability. d) Scale-free
graphs: Shki;(cid:0)(cid:13)
, these are graphs with a connectivity distri-
bution P (k) of the form P (k) / k(cid:0)(cid:13). The connectivity de-
gree, the number of neighbors of a node, decays as a potential
law. This favors the so-called fat-tail phenomena; few nodes
with an extreme high connectivity. We chose the [Barab·asi
and Albert, 1999] model as a model of scale-free graph.

Recent studies on empirical networks show that neither
regular nor random graphs appear in nature. Noticing this,
[Delgado, 2002] studied the effect of complex networks
(small-world and scale-free networks) on the emergence of
coordination and found that this class of networks were as
ef(cid:2)cient as the complete graph in terms of time to reach a
convention, O(N logN ) compared to O(N 3) from regular

graphs, already shown by [Kittock, 1993]. It is important to
stress that many empirical social networks such as the collab-
oration network among actors, the co-authorship network of
researchers on mathematics, the researchers on neuroscience
and many others are classi(cid:2)ed as scale-free networks. How-
ever, for these empirical social networks the clustering coef(cid:2)-
cient found is very high: 0.79, 0.59, 0.76 respectively. Let us
show the clustering coef(cid:2)cient of graphs we will use in the

experiments: C 10

0.0433 and R<10>
works are much more clustered than the scale-free networks
yield by the [Barab·asi and Albert, 1999] model. But we still
use this model since scale-free models are focused in repro-
ducing the connectivity degree rather than clustering. This
fact must be kept in mind when analyzing the results and con-
clusions. For a comprehensive survey in complex networks
see [Albert and Barab·asi, 2002].

3 H CR-Model Experimental Results
We use a graph classi(cid:2)cation based on the clustering coef(cid:2)-
cient, regular and small-world graphs will be called highly-
clustered graphs, and scale-free and random graphs will be
called low-clustered graphs. For the sake of clarity we did
not include results on random graphs in the (cid:2)gures, since they
behave like scale-free graphs.

Let us stress which are the key manipulations in the param-
eters of our model. We systematically variate the proportion
of agents who initially adopt the convention B (rB), the ef-
(cid:2)ciency gap (cid:11) between the two conventions, and (cid:2)nally, the
type of network, in particular its clustering coef(cid:2)cient, that
de(cid:2)nes the agent’s neighborhood.

Another thing to mention before getting into the details is
that there are two clear phases: 1) all the replications converg-
ing to A, and 2) all the replications converging to B. There
is as well a space between these two phases where the sys-
tem converges, with some replications to A and some to B,
which we call transitional space, that is wider or narrower de-
pending on the underlying topology and (cid:11). There is a critical
point r(cid:3)
B that sets the boundaries between the two phases; and
the transitional space may be de(cid:2)ned with an ", such that the
result is: r(cid:3)

B (cid:6) ".

Now, let us comment the results of the experiments on the
HCR model. It is helpful to (cid:2)rst consider the case where
both conventions are equally ef(cid:2)cient ((cid:11) = 1), which is the
case of a pure coordination game. The results for this case
are displayed in sub-(cid:2)gure 2.a. When the initial number of
agents playing B is less than the half of the population, that
is, rB < 1
2 , the system ends up establishing the convention
on B. And, when rB > 1
2 the convention on A is established.
The sub(cid:2)gure shows in particular that this result is widely
independent of the network topology. It also shows that the
transitional space is very narrow except for the regular graphs.
This pattern changes when convention differ in ef(cid:2)ciency.
Sub-(cid:2)gures 2.b and 2.c show the case where the payoff for ac-
tion A exceeds the payoff for B ((cid:11) > 1). To understand the
results, consider an example. Let 3
4 of the population follow
4 follow the action A. In this case, although
the action B, and 1
B is the initially chosen action for most of the agents, coor-
dination in A is more ef(cid:2)cient since it yields a better payoff.
Thus, which will be the (cid:2)nal convention agreed by the whole
population? The answer depends on 1) how much better off,
more ef(cid:2)cient, is the action A over B, denoted by (cid:11). And
2 (sub-(cid:2)gure 2.b) the
2) the underlying topology. If (cid:11) = 3
(cid:2)nal convention will be B when the underlying topology cor-
responds to a random or scale-free graph, A when having a
regular graph, and can be both when having a small-world
graph. By increasing the ef(cid:2)ciency of coordination on A to
(cid:11) = 2 (sub-(cid:2)gure 2.c) both small-world and regular graph
converge to convention A, whereas random and scale-free
graph still converge to convention B. The explanation behind
the result is striking, low-clustered graphs seems very sensi-
tive to the initial population density, whereas highly-clustered
graphs behave in the opposite way, they are more sensitive to
the ef(cid:2)ciency of a particular action.

The conclusion derived from these results can be summed
up as follows: low-clustered agent communities where a con-
vention already exists will not be infected by a set of agents
who play a new action, even though it is more ef(cid:2)cient. Con-
versely, highly-clustered agent communites can be infected
by a new action if the new action is more ef(cid:2)cient, replac-
ing the current convention for the convention on the ef(cid:2)cient
action.

Therefore, highly-clustered agent communities are more
innovative, or adaptive, since a new action can be spread and
(cid:2)nally established as a convention. The drawback would be
that this community would be unstable due to its receptive-
ness to new action, and in the transient time needed to reach a
stable new convention no coordination will exist. In contrast,
low-clustered agent communities are very stable since the in-
fection with a new convention is unlikely to happen, but on
the other hand they are reluctant to adopt new actions even
though they are more ef(cid:2)cient, thus, becoming very conser-
vative and static communities. We must remark that studies
on empirical social networks have shown that these networks
are very clustered [Albert and Barab·asi, 2002].

We do not provide a proof of the system’s convergence.
Nevertheless, throughout all the simulation runs, with their
corresponding replications, the system has always converged
to a convention with an upper bound of O(N 3).

Figure 3: Time to converge to a convention, the value is the mean
over 20 replications. The x-axis is the initial density of agents play-

of interactions (steps) before reaching a convention. Note the loga-
rithmic scale. In the left sub-(cid:2)gure both conventions, A or B. In the
right sub-(cid:2)gure A is the optimal convention since (cid:11) = 2.

ing the HCR-rule over Mi we will transform it as follows:
Let us take kS as the number of neighbors in the same state
as agent i, and kS the number of neighbors in the opposite
state. Therefore, the update is performed if kS > (cid:30)kS, where
(cid:30) is the payoff yield by the payoff matrix G when playing
(S; S). Therefore, the switch from playing A to play B is
done when kB > (cid:11)kA, since G(A; A) = (cid:11). Similarly, the
switch from playing B to play A is done when kA > kB,
since G(B; B) = 1. The probability of updating the state is
de(cid:2)ned by equation 1, we decided to introduce some stochas-
ticity to compensate the fact that now the update is calculated
by the current state of the neighbors instead of by the interac-
tions, as the HCR-rule does.

On (cid:2)gure 3 (left), (cid:11) is set to 1, therefore both conventions
are equally ef(cid:2)cient. It can we observed that the regular graph
takes much longer to converge than the rest of graphs, which
is completely consistent with the (cid:2)ndings of [Kittock, 1993]
and [Delgado, 2002]. Notice the existence of peaks in rB =
2 in all the graphs except regular. These peaks are close to the
1
critical point r(cid:3)
2 where the transition takes place. This
is a typical behavior, when the system is close to a transition
boundary it takes longer to converge [Yeomans, 1992]. The
regular graph, however, is a particular case since it shows a
plateau rather than a peak. This is due to its wide transitional
state, in which different replications of the same setting can
converge to different conventions.

B = 1

On (cid:2)gure 3 (right) the convention A is more ef(cid:2)cient that
convention B, since playing action A yields payoff (cid:11) = 2,
when playing action B yields a payoff 1.
In this case the
plateau of the regular graph does not appear because its tran-
sitional space narrowed as shown in (cid:2)gure 2.c. Thus, we
see only the peaks in rB where the transition takes place
B = f:6; :85; :90g for scale-free, small-world, and regu-
r(cid:3)
lar graphs respectively, which correspond to the transitions
observed in (cid:2)gure 2.c. Again, we observe that the conver-
gence is more inef(cid:2)cient in time when the initial rB is close
B. It is important to remark that the regular graph has
to r(cid:3)
improved its ef(cid:2)ciency in reaching the convention, that is, it
is more ef(cid:2)cient than the small-world graph when (cid:11) = 2. As
was shown by [Young, 1999], convergence to a risk-dominant
equilibrium, which in our case corresponds to the pareto-
ef(cid:2)cient one, is surprisingly rapid provided a close-knit (clus-
tered) graph. The scale-free graph is always the most ef(cid:2)cient
graph in terms of convergence no matter (cid:11), however, scale-
free graphs do not allow convergence to the ef(cid:2)cient conven-
tion unless the initial number of agents playing A is very big,
40% compared to the 15% needed with a small-world graph,
with (cid:11) set to 2).

4 Analytical Model
First of all, we replace the role of past interactions stored
in agent i’s memory (Mi) by the current state of agent i’s
neighbors; notice that in our model we set the memory size
to the average connectivity, M = hki.
Instead of apply-

N

We will use what in physics is called a mean-(cid:2)eld argu-
ment [Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001]. Let NB(t)
be the number of agents playing action B at time t, and
(cid:26)(t) = NA(t)
be the density of agents playing B. A (cid:2)rst
approach is to assume the following homogeneity condition:
for every agent with k neighbors, the number of neighbors
in state B is kB(t) ’ k(cid:26)(t). This condition is completely
ful(cid:2)lled for random graphs, and approximately ful(cid:2)lled for
scale-free and small-world graphs (when p ! 1). Neverthe-
less, this homogeneity condition is not ful(cid:2)lled for regular and
for small-world graphs for low values of p. What breaks the
homogeneity is the clustering coef(cid:2)cient, for low-clustered
graphs this condition holds since the global density of agents
in state S corresponds to the proportion of neighbors in state
S. Intuitively, the clustering coef(cid:2)cient can be de(cid:2)ned as the
probability that a node i and a node j have a link provided
that node l has a link to both i and j. Thus, when cluster-
ing tends to 0 the node’s neighborhood is a good sample of
the graph. However, when clustering coef(cid:2)cient is high the
node’s neighborhood is not a sample of the graph, since its
neighbors form a clique, a close-knit group. Therefore, we
propose a new homogeneity condition that takes clustering
(cc) into account. Let us de(cid:2)ne cc as the clustering coef(cid:2)-
cient, provided that cc is the probability of agent l’s neighbors
being also neighbors, (1 (cid:0) cc)k is the number of neighbors
which are not in the l’s clique, and to whom the previous ho-
mogeneity condition holds. Therefore, for an agent playing
A with k neighbors, the number of neighbors in the opposite
state (B) is kA ’ (1 (cid:0) cc)k(cid:26)(t), which is the cc-biased-
homogeneity condition.

Now we can write an equation for the evolution of (cid:26)(t).
First, notice that the variation of (cid:26)(t) after a small time
interval (cid:1)t is proportional to (cid:1)t, that is, (cid:26)(t + (cid:1)t) =
(cid:26)(t) + @(cid:26)(t)
@t (cid:1)t + O((cid:1)t2). Then, we can neglect the O((cid:1)t2)
term (since we perform a continuum approximation (cid:1)t ! 0)
and compute the variation of (cid:26)(t) as the balance between the
agents switching from action A to B and the agents switching
from action B to A. On one hand, the fraction of agents in
A (that is, 1 (cid:0) (cid:26)(t)) that change to state B in a time interval
(cid:1)t is the product (1 (cid:0) (cid:26)(t))f((cid:26)(t))(cid:1)t, provided (cid:1)t is small
enough; on the other hand, the fraction of agents that switch
from action B to A in (cid:1)t is (cid:26)(t)f(1 (cid:0) (cid:26)(t))(cid:1)t, also for small

We want to study the stable (cid:2)xed points of 3 since these
will give us information on the (cid:2)nal state of the system. Thus
we must (cid:2)nd the solutions of @(cid:26)
@t = 0. As we can see in
4, stable (cid:2)xed points are (cid:26)(cid:3) (cid:24) 0, and (cid:26)(cid:3) (cid:24) 1 (these have
been computed numerically) and the unstable (cid:2)xed-point lies
in (0; 1). In table 1 we display the unstable (cid:2)xed points of
the density equation, which are possible critical points of the
HCR model provided our assumptions (see above) are cor-
rect. Furthermore, in table 1 we (cid:2)nd a comparison between
the analytical unstable (cid:2)xed points and those critical points
coming from the simulation of the HCR model. Notice that
the plausibility of the simplifying assumptions behind our an-
alytical model is supported by the agreement between analyt-
ical and experimental results (remind that rB was sampled
with a resolution of :05).

Figure 4 shows the variation in (cid:26), 4 @(cid:26)

@t , for different (cid:11)
and cc. We can see the effect of (cid:11) enlarging the basin of
attraction of convention A. On the other hand cc has the ef-
fect of reducing the amount of variation due to the effects
of the cc-biased-homogeneity condition. Consequently, the
time elapsed to reach a convention will be longer, and (cid:3)uc-
tuations in initial conditions will have a bigger impact. As a
matter of fact, the experimental results on the HCR model
show us these two consequences apply for highly-clustered
graphs such as the regular graph. The convergence time is
much higher compared to non-clustered graphs. And the tran-
sitional space, where the system can converge either in B or
in A for the same initial parameters, is wider.

5 The Role of Imitation
In this section we will modify the model based of the HCR-
rule introducing an imitation propensity iS, which is the prob-
ability that, after a dyadic interaction where at least one agent

was playing action S, both agents end up playing action B
regardless of the HCR action updating rule. By introducing
an imitation propensity we model the effect of having an at-
tractive action which more likely to be chosen. Imitation is
considered as the key factor of the adoption of norms, and by
extension, conventions. How does the existence of an attrac-
tive action affect the (cid:2)nal convention reached by the agents?
And what if the attractive action happens to be sub-optimal?
In our model coordination on action A is most ef(cid:2)cient solu-
tion (if (cid:11) > 1), however, action B (if iB > 0) might become
a better replicator since it can be adopted by imitation as well
as adopted by the learning process (HCR-rule).

The effect of iB heavily depends on the clustering of the
underlying topology. For instance, when (cid:11) = 2 and iB = :4
the clustered communities adopts the attractive convention
(B) over the ef(cid:2)cient one (A) regardless of the initial den-
sity (rB), while non-clustered communities will still adopt
A provided rB < :25. Therefore, it might be derived that
non-clustered communites are more resilient against attrac-
tive conventions in favor of ef(cid:2)cient conventions. This re-
sult would seem to contradict the previous claim, that clus-
tered communites are better off in converging to the ef(cid:2)cient
convention. However, when iB is small enough, for exam-
ple when iB = :1 the opposite effect is observed, clustered
communities keep on converging to the ef(cid:2)cient convention
regardless of the initial density of agents. This two-fold be-
havior is perfectly clear in the case of the regular graph (left
B under which the
column of (cid:2)gure 5). There is a threshold i(cid:3)
system ends up in the ef(cid:2)cient convention, and over which
the system ends up in the attractive convention. For example
B = :2 when (cid:11) = 2 and the underlying topology is the reg-
i(cid:3)
ular graph. Notice, that this threshold is not found in the case
of the small-world graph whose clustering coef(cid:2)cient is high,
although not so high as the case of the regular graph. How-
ever, even without the threshold we observe a similar behav-
ior than in the regular graph although more progressive. If we
compare it against the behavior of low-clustered graphs, we
(cid:2)nd again that the system is more resilient to the attractive
action invasion for low values of iB. For high values, on the
contrary, the system is very receptive to an invasion of agents
playing the attractive action. We must state that the model is
interesting for small values of iB, for high values of iB the
dichotomy of the agent to choose between the ef(cid:2)cient or the
attractive action dissapear and becomes an epidemic spread
model [Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2001].

Figure 5: Effect of imitation propensity (iB) on the ratio of conven-
tions on action B. iB ranges from [:0:975] in a :0275 resolution, rB
ranges from [:05:95] in a :05 resolution. The sub-(cid:2)gures within the
(cid:2)gures are for the sake of clarity: setting the parameter iB we ob-
serve the evolution of B-conventions depending on rB, which cor-
respond to the way the previous results were shown (when iB = 0).

6 Concluding Remarks
Our research aimed to identify conditions under which local
interactions in a multi agent community can give rise to an
ef(cid:2)cient convention. We have shown that the key factor is the
clustering of the underlying agent’s social network. When
communities are highly-clustered the system converges to
the pareto-ef(cid:2)cient action even though the initial population
choosing that action was clearly a minority. This suggests
that the ef(cid:2)cient convention is a stable convention because
it cannot be invaded by a set of agents playing another sub-
optimal action. However, a sub-optimal convention can be re-
placed by a set of agent playing an action that yields a better
payoff. Accordingly, when the clustering coef(cid:2)cient is high
the system always converges to the most ef(cid:2)cient convention
and this convention is stable. On the other hand when clus-
tering tends to zero the adopted convention depends solely
on the density of agents following an action. If the majority
of agents play the sub-optimal action the inef(cid:2)cient conven-
tion will be established, and it will be stable. To back up our
(cid:2)ndings, we provided an analytical approximation that repro-
duces the results observed in our model based in the HCR-
rule. To do so, we had to introduce a new homogeneity condi-
tion which let us work in clustered graphs, where the classical
mean-(cid:2)eld homogeneity condition is not met.

In accordance with the strong functionalism thesis from
classical sociology, we found that in certain graphs the agent
system was capable to (cid:2)nd and maintain the optimum in the
stable state. However, this only applies to highly-clustered
communities, which resemble many empirical social net-
works. At the same time, our model also corresponds in two
respects to the view that rational choice theorists in sociology
take on social norms. First, we have shown that global ef(cid:2)-

ciency arises from individual goal oriented actions. Second,
we found that under certain conditions optimizing individual
actions fail to generate socially ef(cid:2)cient outcomes, a prob-
lem that is central to the contemporary discussion about the
emergence of conventions and norms.

To conclude, our results seem to correspond more with a
rational choice on norms than with the strong functionalism
thesis. We have shown that socially optimal conventions can
arise from individual optimization, but there is no guarantee
that this happens. In this sense, our model matches well the
ample evidence of examples of suboptimal conventions, for
example in market processes. We believe that a part of the
explanation for this may lie in the competition between opti-
mizing and imitation that we have addressed with our model.
We have shown that imitation processes make it possible for
a sub-optimal yet attractive action to overthrow the ef(cid:2)cient
action, and become stable, provided that its attractiveness is
high enough to be worthy of imitation.
