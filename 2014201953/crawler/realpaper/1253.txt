The  entire  structure  is  as  follows: 

The  categories  assigned  to  these  concepts  are  as 
follows: 

This  system,  with  more  symbols  and  categories 

added,  has  been  made  to  effect  a  set  of  rules 
which  can  account  for  a ll  possible  conceptualiza(cid:173)
tions.  The  relations  inherent  in  these  concep(cid:173)
tualizations  are  intended  to  provide  a  system  for 
representing  the  meaning  of  a  sentence  in  any 
language,  in  language-free  terms. 
(Language 
enters  into  the  conceptual  representation  only  in 
a  naming  capacity.)  A  l i st  of  the  allowable  con(cid:173)
ceptual  dependencies  is  presented  in  the  Appendix. 
In  addition  to  dependencies,  other  relations  are 
allowed  by  the  theory,  e.g.,  conjunctions,  dis(cid:173)
junctions  and  comparatives. 

This  conceptual  framework  can  be  used  to 

write  realization  rules  for  any  language  and  rules 
for  English  have  been  written9.  The  realization 
rules  are  responsible  for  placing  the  entities 
realized  from  the  conceptual  level  in  the  correct 
grammatical  order  to  form  a  sentence.  These  rules 
are  then  the  parsing  rules  for  a  particular  lang(cid:173)
uage. 

The  system  for  analyzing  a  sentence  into  i ts 
conceptual  representation  works  backwards  through 
the  realization  rules  of  a  language. 

In  places 

where  either  of  two  rules  could  apply,  the  system 
can  build  upon  both  of  them,  aborting  if  one  anal(cid:173)
ysis  leads  to  an  impossible  conceptual  structure, 
or  producing  multiple  analyses  for  ambiguous  sen(cid:173)
tences.  A ll  conceptualizations  are  checked 
against  a  l i st  of  experiences  to  see  if  that  part(cid:173)
icular  part  of  the  construction  has  occurred  be(cid:173)
fore. 
If  the  construction  has  not  occurred,  or 
has  occurred  only  in  some  peculiar  context,  this 
is  noted.  Thus,  in  the  construction  'ideas  <=>

it  is  discovered  that  this  connection  has 
never  been  made  before,  and  is  therefore  meaning(cid:173)

a  record  of  what  it  has  heard  before  in  order  to 
analyze  what  it  is  presently  hearing.

In  order  for  the  system  to  choose  between  two 
analyses  of  a  sentence  both  of  which  are  feasible 
with  respect  to  the  conceptual  rules  (see  Appendix) 
a  conceptual  semantics  is  incorporated.  The  con(cid:173)
ceptual  semantics  is  a  data  base  which  limits  the 
possible  conceptual  dependencies  to  statements  con(cid:173)
sonant  with  the  system's  knowledge  of  the  real 
world.  The  definition  of  each  concept  is  composed 
of  records  organized  by  type  of  dependency  and  by 
conceptual  category  of  the  dependent.  For  each 
type  of  dependency,  semantic  categories  (such  as 
animate  object,  human  i n s t i t u t i o n,  animal  motion) 
are  delimited  with  respect  to  the  conceptual  cate(cid:173)
gory  of  a  given  concept,  and  defining  characteris(cid:173)
tics  are  inserted  when  they  are  known.  For 
example,  concepts  in  the  semantic  category  'physi(cid:173)
cal  object'  a ll  have  the  characteristic 
Sometimes  this  information  is  intrinsic  to  the

'shape'. 

'balls 

The  semantic  categories  are  organized  into 
hierarchical  structures  in  which  limitations  on 
any  category  are  assumed  to  apply  as  well  to  a ll 
categories  subordinate  to  i t.  The  system  of 
semantic  categories  and  a  method  of  constructing 
semantic  f i l es  is  discussed  more  f u l ly  in  a  pre(cid:173)
vious  paper9. 

In  the  present  system,  the  f i l es  are  con(cid:173)
structed  by  incorporating  information  derived 
from  rules  presented  as  English  sentences.  The 
program  parses  each  of  these  sentences,  observes 
which  dependencies  are  new,  and  then  adds  them  to 
the  f i l e s. 

4.  Conceptual  Analysis 

In  the  Conceptual  Dependency  theory  on  which 
our  program  is  based,  the  parsing  procedure  begins 
by  looking  up  the  conceptual  category  of  a  word. 
If  the  conceptual  category  is  either  PP  or  ACT, 
the  concept  evoked  by  the  word  being  considered  is 
placed  directly  into  the  conceptual  network. 
Otherwise  the  concept  is  queued  u n t il  a  permissible 
conceptual  governor  enters  the  system.  Preposi(cid:173)
tions,  conjunctions,  and  determiners  are  similarly 
queued.  A  permissible  conceptual  governor  is  one 
whose  category  is  on  the  l e ft  hand  side  of  a  con(cid:173)

-571-

ceptual  rule  (see  Appendix)  and  where  the  depen(cid:173)
dency  effected  by  the  use  of  that  rule  is  allowed 
by  the  conceptual  semantics.  11  (An  example  of  the 
conceptual  semantics  is  given  in  the  Appendix.) 

If  a  permissible  conceptual  governor  has  been 
found  for  a  queued  concept,  the  queued  concept  is 
placed  in  the  network  with  the  appropriate  depen(cid:173)
dency.  A  governor  is  not  placed  directly  in  the 
network  unless  it  satisfies  the  conceptual  seman(cid:173)
tics  with  respect  to  i ts  dependencies. 

Ambiguous  interpretations  of  a  piece  of  dis(cid:173)
course  are  b u i lt  up  if  more  than  one  conceptual 
rule  may  apply. 
If  the  conceptual  semantics  dis(cid:173)
allows  an  interpretation,  the  dependency  is 
aborted. 
If  more  than  one  network  remains  after 
the  conceptual  semantics  have  been  checked  multi(cid:173)
ple  analyses  are  b u i lt  up.  Semantic  ambiguity 
(that  i s,  multiple  meanings  for  a  word)  is  also 
handled  by  the  conceptual  semantics. 
If  a  word 
connects  to  more  than  one  concept,  each  concept 
is  checked  for  the  appropriate  possibilities  of 
dependence.  The  concept  that  f i ts  according  to 
the  semantics  is  the  word-sense  chosen. 
If  more 
than  one  concept  f i t s,  more  than  one  network  is 
b u i lt  up.  The  semantics  are  checked  as  each  de(cid:173)
pendent  is  added,  so  it  is  possible  to  abort  a 
multiple  network  at  a  later  poin 
in  the  parse. 

As  an  example  of  the  strategy  employed  in  the 

theory  it  is  illuminating  to  follow  the  parse  of 
an  example  sentence.  Consider: 

'The  t a ll  boy  went  to  the  park  with  a  g i r l1. 

The  machine  tries  to  simulate  the  behavior  of  a 
human  in  perceiving  this  sentence.  Thus,  it  is 
continually  operating  and  making  hypotheses  as 
each  word  enters  the  system. 

When  'The'  enters,  it  is  held  in  waiting  as 

it  may  be  a  link  to  a  previous  mention  of  the 
next  PP  which  w i ll  enter  the  system.  That  i s, 
'the'  would  be  replaced  by  'a'  in  an  ordinary 
dialogue  if  i ts  specific  referent  were  previously 
unmentioned  or  unknown. 

' T a l l'  is  marked  as  a  PA. 

It  is  therefore 
queued  u n t il  a  rule  that  uses  PA  as  a  dependent 
can  apply.  Since  'boy'  is  a  PP,  it  is  placed 
directly  in  the  network.  Previous  networks  gen(cid:173)
erated  by  the  user  are  searched  for  an  instance 
of  'boy'  to  which  the  'the'  refers  and  a  link  is 
made  if  one  is  found.  The  conceptual  rule  'PP  <-
'PA  PP:  2; 
PA'  is  keyed  by  the  realization  rule 

the  numbers  are  place  markers  representing  rela(cid:173)
tive  position  in  the  piece  of  discourse.  The  PA 
is  below  the  line  to  indicate  that  this  dependent 
is  an  attribute  of  i ts  governor.  The  'PP  <- PA' 
semantics  for  'boy'  are  checked  to  see  if  the  con(cid:173)
junction  'boy
