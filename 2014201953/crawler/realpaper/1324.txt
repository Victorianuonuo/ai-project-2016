VIS  is  a  s e r i al  system.  Only  one  rule  f i r es  at  a 

time.  VIS  has  an  ad  hoc  mechanism  for  e f f i c i e n t ly 
selecting  which  rule  to  f i re  next.  The  rules  are 
into  groups  (called  procedures),  w i t h in  which 
bunched 
the  rules  are 
t o t a l ly  ordered.  Only  one  procedure  is 
active  at  a  time;  and  this  is  controlled  by  a  stack  of 
procedure  names  (which  is  considered  to  be  part  of 
SIM). 

The  Program 

Verbal  protocols  were  taken  of 

these  experimental 

sessions.  The  subject's  (verbal)  behavior  was  analyzed 
by  creating  a  simulation  program.  The  program  takes 
the  directions  as  input  and  produces  a  stylized  verbal 
output.  Figure  2  presents  a  short  segment  of  the 
subject's  protocol  lor  Problem  1  along  with  the 
corresponding  program  output. 

More 

important  than  the  verbalizations 

themselves 

is  what  we  can  i n f er  from  them  about  the  subject's 
internal  representations  and  processes.  The  program 
was  designed  to  satisfy  not  only  the  external 
constraints  of  matching  the  protocol,  but  also  some  of 
the  known  internal  memory  l i m i t a t i o ns  of  the  human 
information  processor;  and  so  the  program  is  w r i t t en 
in  a  system  based  on  some  specific  hypotheses  about 
the  structure  of  the  human  information  processor.

not  have  any  specific  goals  to  reach.  Hence, 
the  task 
cannot  be  characterized  as  searching  in  a  problem 
space. 
(As  a  r e s u l t,  the  subject's  high-level  goals

subject's  behavior  was  not  simulated  by  hand,  but 
rather  the  analysis  was  carried  out  using  the

at  a  very  fine  level  of  d e t a i l,  using  only  simple 
symbolic  operations  as  p r i m i t i v e s;  no  high-level

encoding  plus  generic  knowledge  about  figures  or 
whether  it  is  a  r e c a ll  operation  from  ITM  (as  in  my 
present  program).  But  the  subject  makes  no 
regeneration/recall  errors  and  gives  no  clues  as  to 
the  exact  nature  of  this  process.  Either  technique, 
in  e f f e c t,  comes  out  looking  the  same.  A  specific

Is  each  step

for  representations  has  been  set  up,  we  are  ready  to 
design  and  use  experiments  which  address  some  of  the 
specific  issues  raised.  For  example, 
tasks  requiring 
more  specific  kinds  of  spatial  manipulation  (such  as 
Shepard's  mental  r o t a t i on  tasks)  would  help  to  focus
