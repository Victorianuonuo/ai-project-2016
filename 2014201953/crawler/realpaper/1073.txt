Abstract

This paper presents a methodology for integrating
features within the occupancy grid (OG) framework.
The OG maps provide a dense representation of the
environment. In particular they give information for
every range measurement projected onto a grid.
However independence assumptions between cells
during updates as well as not considering sonar
models lead to inconsistent maps, which may also
lead the robot to take some decisions which may be
unsafe or which may introduce an unnecessary
overhead of run-time collision avoidance behaviors.

between cells. But they are sparse due to sparseness

accurate and safe representation than standard OG

updated with a response value if it gave a response in at-
least one of the n considered directions. In [Thrun 2003] a

circular scan of the environment by initially identifying
regions of constant depths (RCD).
In [Strachniss and
Burgard 2003] coverage maps were presented as alternatives
to traditional OG maps [Elfes 1989]. Though not primarily
from the point of view of alleviating sonar noise the method
of giving coverage values to cells instead of the traditional
occupancy/non occupancy values could mitigate some of the
challenges posed by sonar data.

1 Introduction

This paper provides a framework by which any number of
environment features can be integrated within the OG
paradigm. OG methods provide dense maps but the veracity
of these maps is questionable under the duress of sensor
noise especially with sonar. For example figure 1 shows a
rectangular environment with the corresponding OG map
overlaid. Large deviations from the ground truth are seen
essentially because of specular reflection when the conical
beam of the sonar is not normal to the surface that it is
impinging. It is obvious from figure 1 that some walls have
been destroyed by the OG map and shown as empty space.
A decision taken by the robot based on this map may be
prone to danger or at least run time collision avoidance
overhead will be increased.

We are thankful to Ms. Shweta Kumari for her help in different
phases of completion of this work.

In this paper we present a novel method of integrating
features within an OG framework and show performance

the traditional OG paradigm in number of runs. As far as
our knowledge goes we have not come across a similar
method in literature. Hybrid maps [Nieto et. al, 2004] offer

use of the probabilistic framework of OG. Moreover the
method makes use of image data rather than sonar and is
disparate from this effort of tackling sonar challenges. The
other novelties of
this method include its providing a
convenient framework of integrating several features within
the Bayesian update scheme of OG. Thereby it combines the
elegance and ease of OG updates with the consistency of
feature based mapping. Dense OG maps that are not subject

2 Methodology

2.1 Categorizing RCD

Consider a sensor moving on a circle of radius R centered at
O', the robot's center. Let successive measurement be at an
angular spacing of . Then the measurement of a plane
returns back would have theoretically a
surface that
td  R (1-cos). The difference
td between
difference of
two consecutive scan locations S1 and S2 is shown in figure
2a. The assumption is that as long as a part of the conical
wavefront of the transducer hit the surface normally, it is
returned back to the transducer. This assumption is along
the lines reported in [Leonand and Whyte 1992]. For a
corner the difference theoretically would be higher and also
varies for every scan, since the corner reflection is returned
to the transducer from a single point than from a surface

measurements Z= {Z1, Z2, ..., Zn} that satisfies the threshold
criteria is classified as a wall RCD. A plot of this minimum
number versus mean distance of the candidate RCD points
is shown in fig. 2b. Our algorithm extracts only wall RCD's
from any circular scan.

2.2 Existence of a wall, Computing P(WE)

The existence of a wall is synonymous with existence of the
wall RCD described above. The probability of existence of a

wall, (

2.3 Existence of a corner, Computing P(CE)

The probability of existence of a corner is obtained as
follows. Wall RCDs are parameterized as straight lines. The
point of intersection of any pair of such lines is computed
and denoted as IP in figure 3b. Let dc be distance of the
closest range measurement Z projected on the plane from
IP. Let distance d1 and d2 be the distances from the corner
point to the closest end points of the wall obtained so far.

In other words we say a corner exists if a measurement
is obtained that is close enough to nearest end point of the
two walls and close enough to the point of intersection of
the two walls. Based on empirical results we found that
above classification scheme never wrongly asserts the
existence of a corner when there is none. It asserts the
existence of a corner to an accuracy of 95 in 100 if there is
actually one. Figure 3a shows graph of P(d1) versus d1 while
3b shows how d1, d2 and dc are computed. Similar graphs
are used for computing P(d2) and P(dc).

2.11 Associating RCD’S:

Every new 360 scan results in new RCD’S as well as RCD’s
that need to be associated with previous ones. Two RCD’s
are associated if their line segment (walls) fitted on them
intersect at angles less than 5 degrees. In such a case the wall
that was obtained at closer range from the robot is taken as
the feature and points on the other wall are associated with
this one and updated as mentioned before. RCD’s that are
separated by some spacing between them are not explicitly
associated with one another. In figure 8a 2 RCD’s are
associated because of overlap and the wall gets extended.
The 2 RCDs in figure 8b are not associated due to spacing
between them and treated as independent walls.

3.1 Analysis:

A more rigorous scheme for comparing performances of the
two methods is developed here. The actual map is overlaid
on cells along with the maps obtained by OG and current
methods. The actual map is compared with the two methods
through a scheme that assigns error levels/values as shown
in table 1. Test1 (table 1) finds if there is at least 1 occupied
cell in the immediate neighborhood of the current cell, in the
obtained map, while test2 does the same in the original map.
Based on these assignments an error level greater than or
equal
to 3 are dangerous, for they show cells that are
occupied or unknown as unoccupied. A robot visiting those
cells based on these assignments is prone to collide with
objects or will have run time collision avoidance overheads.
Maps will be less accurate if neither
its
neighbors resemble the original cells’ states. A map will
have exploration overhead if
regions which should be
known from a specific set of scans are still remaining as
unknown. This will be slightly more in the present method
because it finds out noisy readings as outliers and updates
only till features, leaving some cells unknown as mentioned
in 2.10

both methods, for different environments. Z1 = Accurate, Z2 =
Safe, Z3 = Exploration Overhead, Z4 = Less Accuracy (for
safe zone cells only), Z5 = Danger. Reduction in danger
regions based on Z5 is at-least 95% by present method.

Table 2 shows corresponding values as follows. The
dangerous cells (Z5 in table 2 corresponding to error levels
> 2.5 in table 1) are at-least 20 to 50 times higher in the OG
methods over the current method. Overall at-least 95% of
the danger regions have been reduced by the current method
(last column shows the percentage reduction of danger
cells). The table also shows the number of cells classified as
accurate (Z1) to be more in the present method. The
number of cells with exploration overhead is slightly higher
in the current method due to reasons mentioned before. The
number of cells with error levels less than 3 (those that
belong to safe zone or Z2=Z1+Z3+Z4) is once again higher
for the present method. The number of overall inaccurate
cells (Z5+Z4) is significantly lesser by current method.
Note that all cells in danger zone are also inaccurate. In
absolute terms there are at-least 2 x 103 more number of
cells of 4cm2 area that are mapped wrongly in the OG
paradigm when compared with the current method for the
rectangular environment. This number is even higher for the
corridor environments. The performance gain of the current
method was of

from the standard OG update; the physics of the sonar is
being accounted for more in the current method. Typically
at corners and at walls that are not at right angles to the
conical front of the transmitted beam the measurement
errors are significant due to specular and possibly multiple
reflections. By understanding the presence of features at
those locations through the RCD and by associating future
measurements to those features the error is considerably
reduced, consistency with ground truth increased. Secondly
associating measurements to features also implicitly takes
care to certain degree what is often called the bane of the

neighboring cells. Thirdly the method of delayed update,
mentioned before, of measurements not associated to any
features at the current instant overcomes the inconsistencies
that arise when a measurement that actually is due to a
feature is updated as
such. Delayed update reduces
inconsistencies that depict cells occupied behind features
that should actually be depicted as unknown.

4 Conclusions

This paper has presented a method of overcoming some of
the limitations of the OG paradigm which get pronounced
especially with sonar data without sacrificing the elegancy
associated with the OG method in the form of Bayesian
updates. This it does by integrating features within the OG
updates thereby alleviating problems associated with the
peculiarities of sonar range data. From an OG perspective
the method captures the physics of the sonar by initially
identifying existence of
features. By associating future
measurements to these features it mitigates the chief
problem of OG albeit
independence
assumption between neighboring cells during updates. The
nature of the formulation presented is such that any number
of features can be integrated within the OG paradigm. Also
since it enhances the performance of OG and also extracts
and uses the features like wall and corners, so any method
of SLAM either based on feature or OG can perform with
more accuracy. Extensive experiments and analysis reported
confirm the performance gain of the current approach over
the traditional OG method of building maps.
