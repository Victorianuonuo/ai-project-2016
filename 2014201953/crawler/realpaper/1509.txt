ABSTRACT 

The  comprehension  of  dialogue  is  an  important  concern 
for  those  interested  in  natural  language  processing  for  several 
reasons:  dialogue  gives  particularly  good  access 
to  human 
communication  phenomena,  it  is  less  contrived  than  authored 
text,  and  human  dialogue  provides  useful  analogies 
for 
improving  man-machine  communication.

theoretical  constructs

proposed  by 
to  explain  certain 
kinds  of  regularities  observed  in  naturally  occurring  dialogues. 
These  regularities  have  been  called  "rules"  by  Labov  &  Fanshel

Once  these  multisentential  knowledge  units  are  evoked, 
they  serve  as  a  basis  for  comprehending  the  successive  inputs. 
This  is  achieved  by  generating  expectations  and  by  providing  a 
framework  for  integrating  the  comprehension  of  an  utterance 
with  that  of  its  predecessors.  Recently,  we  proposed  (Levin  &

specified  primarily  by  the  speaker's  and  hearer's  goals.  These

language 
comprehension  is  posed  by  sentences  with  which  the  speaker 
performs  what  philosophers  of  language  have  called  "indirect 
speech  acts"  (Searle,  1975). 
The  direct  comprehension  of 
these  sentences  fails  to  derive  the  main  communicative  effect.

have  been  extensively  analyzed  by  philosophers  of  language 
(Austin,  1962;  Searle,  1969,  1975;  Grice,  1975),  are  not

THE  SHAPE OF  THE  THEORY 

Our  theory  of  human  use  of  language  has  been  strongly 
influenced  by  work  in  human  problem  solving  (Newell  &  Simon, 
1972),  in  which  the  behavior  of  a  human  is  modeled  as  an 
information-processing  system,  having  goals 
to  pursue  and 
selecting  actions  which  tend  to  achieve  the  goals.  We  view 
humans  as  engaging  in  linguistic  behavior  in  order  to  advance 
the  state  of  certain  of

USE OF  DIALOCUE-CAMES  IN THE COMPREHENSION OF 
DIALOGUE 

In  this  section  we  describe  the  five  stages  of  dialogue 
assimilation:  nomination,  recognition,  instantiation,  conduct,  and 
termination,  and  detail  the  involvement  of  Dialogue-games  with 
each  stage. 

Nomination 

When  dialogue  participants  propose  a  new 

type  of 
interaction,  they  do  not  consistently  use  any  single  word  or 
phrase 
to  name  the  interaction.  Thus  we  cannot  determine

in  a  particular  dialogue 
through  a  simple  invocation, by  name  (or  any  other  foreknown 
collection  of  words  or  phrases). 
Instead  the  dialogue  type  is 
communicated  by  attempts  to  establish  various  entities  as  the 
values  of  the  Parameters  of  the  desired  Dialogue-game.  Thus,

The  model  derives  the  implicitly  communicated  content  in 
two  ways:  by  asserting  the  parameter  specifications  whenever

In  some  rather  ordinary  contexts,  the  occurrence  of  (2) 
would  be  seen  as  an  information  request,  in  which  "Do  you 
have  a  match?"  functions  as  a  simple  question. 
In  contrast,  (3)

We  would  expect 

to  correctly  respond 

in 
these  two  different  ways.  For  (2),  it  would  posit  the  goal  of 
knowing  whether  the  hearer  has  a  match,  and  regard  it  is  a 
plausible  goal  of  a  survey 
The  question  would  be 
assimilated  as  pursuit  of  that  goal,  and  not  seen  as  indirect. 
For  (3)  there  is  no  corresponding  goal,  and  so  the  question 
would  be  identified  with  a  precondition  of  an  action  (giving  a 
match)  and 
thereby  be  analyzed  as  indirect.  This  result  is 
preferable  to  any  sort  of  analysis  that  treats  the  questions  in 
(2)  and  (3)  alike.  The  example  also  illustrates  how  inference 
limitation  is  often  necessary  to  correct  assimilation  of  implicit 
communication. 

When  this  proposition  is  asserted,  the  analysis  of  the 
current  utterance  stops  and  the  next  utterance  is  processed 
by  the  Parser.  This  "stopping  rule"  is  a  selective  method  for 
limiting  the  amount  of  inference  applied  to  utterances.  Since

Without  some  specific  notion  of  what  kinds  of  performance  are 
of  interest,  we  would  have  no  basis  for  claiming  that  the  model 
is  correct,  effective,  working,  or  better  than  previous  models. 
The  common  practise  of  simply  presenting  examples  does  not 
yield  a  significant  performance  assessment,  in  part  because  it 
fails  to  characterize  the  range  of  inputs  over  which  the  model 
is  effective. 

We  have  attempted  to  develop  a  more  suitable  basis  for 
performance  assessment  which  would  identify  phenomena  of

To  obtain  these  judgments  we  have  developed  a  Topic

The  method  gives  systematic 
instructions  for  annotating  topic  beginnings  and  topic  endings 
for  each  of

scopes  of  topics  and  assign  labels  which  indicate  when  topics 
are  resumed  or  shared  by  the  two  parties.  The  annotations 
thus  specify  topological  attributes  of  the  text.  Figure  5  shows 
an  example  of  topic  annotation  of  a  dialogue.

several  interesting  properties  of  people's  knowledge  of  Topic.

the  "current  topic"  of  the  dialogue  as  a  whole.  Also,  there  is  a 
significant  fraction  of  dialogue  devoted  to  negotiating  what  the 
following  topic  shall  be.  People  label  topics  idiosyncratically, 
so  that  what  one  person  regards  as  a  topic  of  "Medical  Ethics" 
another 
"Doctor-Owned

occur  is  not  idiosyncratic.  This  method  was  developed  as  part 
of  a  group  of  annotation  methods  intended  to  operationalize 
particular  human  communication  phenomena 
(Mann,  Moore,
