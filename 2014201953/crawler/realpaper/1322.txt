Scanning  the  Board 

The  game  board  serves  as  an  external  memory  for 

, 1 5, 

human  players.  This  external  memory  is  simulated  by  a 
2-dimensional  array  which  remains  conceptually  d i s t i n ct 
from  the  model.  The  problem  of  scanning  the  board  may 
be  thought  of  as  a  problem  of  parsing  a  2-dimensional 
s t r i n g.  Top-down  parsing  algorathms  which  have  been 
used  as  a  mechanism  for  the  analysis  of  line  drawings9, 
capture  the  predictive  power  and  analysis-by-

Bottom-
up  parsers  ( e . g .,  Ledley 
)  capture  the  essence  of  or(cid:173)
ganization  of  visual  scenes  for  which  there  are  no  ex(cid:173)

t i o n s,  which  is  a  disadvantage  for  an  optimal  game 
playing  machine,  but  a  necessity  for  a  r e a l i s t ic  model 
of  human  game  playing. 

The  scanning  routine  used  by  our  model  begins  with 
a  bottom-up  parse  of  the  board,  but  becomes  a  top-down 
parse  as  soon  as  enough  information  is  gathered  to  gen(cid:173)

The  top-down  parse  starts  with  an  attempt  to  identi(cid:173)
fy 
f a m i l i ar  patterns  derived  from  Gestalt  principles  of 
human  perception.  The  three  Gestalt  principles  includ(cid:173)
ed  in  the  model  are  those  of  proximity,  s i m i l a r i t y,  and 
continuity.11  Proximity  is  incorporated  by  having  the 
scan  move  outwards  from  the  o r i g in  in  expanding  concen(cid:173)

The  p r i n c i p le  of  s i m i l a r i ty  is  embodied 
by  marking  "piece  next  to  a  similar  piece"  as  a  familiar 
pattern  for  a ll  games. 
incorporated  by  regarding  lines  of  pieces  as  inherently 
f a m i l i ar  patterns.  Consequently,  a  potential 
l i ne  of 
pieces  seen  in  the  i n i t i al  3x3  area  w i ll  result  in  the 
i n i t i a t i on  of  a  top-down  search  for  that 

The  p r i n c i p le  of  continuity  is 

l i n e. 

Note  that  although  patterns  are  " f a m i l i a r ,"  they 

are  not  necessarily  meaningful  w i t h in  the  context  of  a 
p a r t i c u l ar  game.  Thus,  a  row  of  four  bishops  side  by 
side  on  a  chess  board  w i ll  be  called  " f a m i l i a r"  by  the 
Gestalt  p r i n c i p l e s,  although  the  i n t r i n s ic 
importance 
of  such  a  configuration  is  not  at  a ll  clear. 

Once  simple  Gestalt  groupings  are  recognized, 

top-down  scan  continues  looking  for  other  potential 
patterns 
( if  other  p o t e n t i al  ones  are  indicated).  The 
remaining  ones  are  those  which  are  important  w i t h in  the 
context  of  the  s p e c i f ic  game  currently  being  played.6

Evaluation 

The  evaluation  of  moves 

is  based  on  the  dimensions 

stored  under  a  "strategy"  node.  For  example,  on  the 
dimension  of  " l e n g t h ,"  a  s t r i ng  of  f i ve  in  a  row  has  a 
greater  value  than  a  s t r i ng  of  four  in  a  row. 
If  we 
are  comparing  two  moves  along  the  dimension  of  "cap(cid:173)
ture  value,"  we  might  compare  the  number  of  pieces  cap(cid:173)
tured 
in  checkers),  or  the  numerical  value  which 
some  book  or  t u t or  has  t o ld  us  to  assign  to  the  cap(cid:173)
tured  pieces  ( e . g ., 
in  chess).  Relevant  dimensions  are 
stored  e x p l i c i t ly  under  the  strategy  node,  but  are  d i f-
ferent 

for  d i f f e r e nt  games. 

[ e . g ., 

Actual  numerical  values  are  not  computed  in  the  cur(cid:173)

sequence  in  which  d i f f e r e nt  dimensions  are  encountered, 
but  we  allow  an  ordering  of  the  nodes  within  a  given 
dimension.

of  playing  is  for  one  of  the  players  to 
achieve  some  winning  state.  Games  have  some 
setup  [e.g.  board,  pieces].  Games  have  legal 
moves  which  are  made  by  players.  A  legal  move 
specifies  some  object  [e.g.  'knight,' 
i ts  starting  location  [ i . e.  current  location], 
and  i ts  final  location. 
can  be  defined  in  terms  of  i ts  spatial  relation 
to  the  starting  location,  and  can  include  any 

[The  final  location 

'bishop'], 

The  empty  ovals  represent  tokens  of  the  "act"  to 

which  they  point.  Empty  brackets  represent  argument 
slots  which  are  f i l l ed  in  with  information  either 
e x p l i c i t ly  mentioned  or  derived  from  the  rules  of  spe(cid:173)
c i f ic  games.  The  English  equivalent  of  this  network  is 
as  follows  (note  that  statements  in  brackets  are  c l a r i(cid:173)

blocked  diagonal  to  either  an  unoccupied 
square  or  a  Square  occupied  by  an  opponent's 
piece'),]  Games  have  moves  which  must  be 
legal  moves.  Moves  have  a  goal  and  a 
result.

The  "must-be"  relation  between  MOVE  and  LEGAL-MOVE  has 
the  following  implications:  For  each  node  W  such  that 

W-^MOVE  and  W  relation(i)| > x> 

there  exists  a  node  Y  such  that 

Y - J ^i LEGAL-MOVE  a nd  y  r e l a t i o n^ 

and  X  is  within  the  range  defined  by  2, 

The  result  of  each  move  is  a  new  configuration  on 
the  board,  plus  whatever  changes  occur  in  the  player's 
conceptions  of  the  game  which  are  the  result  of  a  re-
evaluation  of  the  board.  The  goal  of  each  move  is  de(cid:173)
rived  from  the  strategies  for  generating  good  moves. 
If  present,  such  goals  are  regarded  as  being  the  rea(cid:173)
