Abstract

Importance of contraction for belief change
notwithstanding, literature on iterated belief change
has by and large centered around the issue of iter-
ated belief revision, ignoring the problem of iter-
ated belief contraction. In this paper we examine
iterated belief contraction in a principled way, start-
ing with Qualiﬁed Insertion, a proposal by Hans
Rott. We show that a judicious combination of
Qualiﬁed Insertion with a well-known Factoring
principle leads to what is arguably a pivotal prin-
ciple of iterated belief contraction. We show that
this principle is satisﬁed by the account of iterated
belief contraction modelled by Lexicographic State
Contraction, and outline its connection with Lex-
icographic Revision, Darwiche-Pearl’s account of
revision as well as Spohn’s Ordinal ranking theory.

Keywords: Belief Change,
Change, Iterated Belief Contraction.

Information State

Literature on belief change deals with the problem of how
new evidence impinges upon the current knowledge of a ra-
tional agent. The pioneering works in the area such as [Al-
chourr´on et al., 1985] provide the formal framework, and the
solution for “one-shot belief change”. Follow up work in the
[Williams, 1994; Nayak, 1994; Boutilier, 1996]
area, e.g.
have explored the related issue of Iterated Belief Change that
deals with sequential changes in belief. This latter research
has by and large been conﬁned to iterated belief revision:
Given belief corpus K, two sequential pieces of evidence
x, y and revision operator ∗, how do we construct the resul-
tant corpus (K ∗
y? However, the accompanying problem of
iterated belief contraction, namely, Given belief corpus K,
two beliefs x, y that are to be sequentially removed from K,
and contraction operator −, how do we construct the resul-
tant corpus (K −
y ? has, for no obvious reason, been rather
neglected. Very few reseach works, e.g., [Bochman, 2001;
Chopra et al., 2002; Rott, 2001; 2006] and [Nayak et al.,
2006], have addressed this problem. The primary aim of this

paper is to examine this problem from what we may call the
“ﬁrst principles” of belief change.

In Section 1, we introduce the problem of iterated belief
contraction, and as a starting point, take up a proposal by
Hans Rott [Rott, 2001] called Qualiﬁed Insertion.
In the
next section, we examine this principle and its variations, and
show that when combined with Factoring, a well-known re-
sult in belief change, Qualiﬁed Insertion can lead to a good
account of iterated belief contraction. In Section 3 we study
some interesting properties of this contraction, followed by
its semantic modelling via Lexicographic state contraction in
Section 4. We conclude with a short summary.

1 Background

The theory of belief change purports to model how a current
theory or body of beliefs, K, can be rationally modiﬁed in
order to accommodate a new observation x. An observation,
such as x, is represented as a sentence in a propositional lan-
guage L, and a theory, such as K, is assumed to be a set of
sentences in L, closed under a supra-classical consequence
operation, Cn. Since the new piece of information x may
contravene some current beliefs in K, chances are, some be-
liefs in K will be discarded before x is eased into it. Accord-
ingly, three forms of belief change are recognised in the belief
change framework:

1. CONTRACTION: K −

x is the result of discarding some

unwanted information x from the theory K

2. EXPANSION: K +

x is the result of simple-mindedly in-
corporating some information x into the theory K, and

3. REVISION: K ∗

x is the result of incorporating some in-
formation x into the theory K in a manner so as to avoid
internal contradiction in K ∗
x.

The intuitive connection among these operators is captured by
the following two identities named, respectively, after Isaac
Levi and William Harper:
LEVI IDENTITY: K ∗
HARPER IDENTITY: K −

¬x)+
x = K ∗

x , and
¬x ∩ K.

x = (K −

A belief change (revision, contraction and expansion)
operation is AGM-RATIONAL if
it satisﬁes the corre-
sponding set of AGM rationality postulates. The three
sets of postulates, along with motivation and interpreta-
tion for them, may be found in [G¨ardenfors, 1988].
It is

well known that a revision operator constructed from an
AGM-rational contraction operation via the Levi Identity
is AGM rational; and conversely AGM-rational revision
operations can be used to construct AGM-rational contrac-
tion operations via the Harper Identity. For convenience
we reproduce the AGM postulates for contraction below.

The expansion operation is very easily constructed: K +

atively more sophisticated operations since they deal with

It is easily noticed that the AGM postulates of contraction
deal with “one-shot” belief contraction. The only constraint
of interest on iterated contraction that they impose is:
Vacuity Specialised If y (cid:5)∈ K −
y = K −
x

x , then (K −

x )−

which is not really much of a constraint.1 In particular, postu-
lates (7−) and (8−) impose very little. Consider the follow-
ing example to see how ineffective the AGM postulates are in
dealing with sequential contraction.

Example 1 Suppose I believe on independent grounds that
both a: Argentina will qualify for the FIFA
world-cup final and b: Brazil will qualify
for the FIFA world-cup final.2 Thus my knowl-
edge corpus is K = Cn(a, b), whereby a ∨ b ∈ K.

Since I believe a and b on independent grounds, arguably
a = Cn(b) and K −
b = Cn(a). Moreover, since my belief
K −
in a∨b is assumed to have no independent standing, we would
expect a “correct” belief contraction operation to behave in
a way such that both a ∨ b (cid:5)∈ (K −
b )−
a .
This however is not mandated by the AGM postulates. We
can plausibly argue that K −
a∧b = Cn(b) given Brazil’s past
record.This will satisfy all the eight postulates of contrac-
tion.3 However, since b ∈ K −
a , the postulates do not con-
strain the content of (K −
b in any interesting way at all. In
particular, the postulates cannot insist on the absence of a ∨ b
in the resultant belief corpus, contrary to our intuition.

b and a ∨ b (cid:5)∈ (K −

a )−

a )−

Not many researchers have examined iterated belief con-
traction in a principled way, an exception being Hans
Rott who has advocated the following principle [Rott,
2001](p.221):

1If ∅ (cid:3) y, then by RECOVERY (K −

x )−

y = K −

x . We assume

throughout the paper that y is a removable belief, i.e., (cid:4)(cid:3) y.

2Both Argentina and Brazil had qualiﬁed to play in the quarters-
ﬁnals by the time this paper was being written. Italy played France
in the ﬁnal and won the 2006-world-cup.

3Readers acquainted with the semantics involved can verify it by
considering the following plausibility rank-order over the worlds:
ab < ab < ab < ab where ab is the most preferred world.

This is indeed an appealing suggestion. Its ﬁrst part is simply
Vacuity Specialised, justiﬁed by the AGM rationality postu-
lates. As to the second part of this principle, since both x and
y are individually removed from K sequentially, it stands to
reason that when the second contraction is non-vacuous, the
result should consist of the beliefs that resist removal in indi-
vidual contractions of K by x and y.

Despite the intuitive plausibility of Qualiﬁed Insertion, its

inadequacy is established by the Example 2 below.

We ﬁnd that Qualiﬁed Insertion, though intuitive, fails to offer
an acceptable account of Iterated Belief Contraction. We take
this to be the starting point of this paper. In the next section
we analyse this principle to arrive at what we consider to be
a pivotal principle of iterated belief contraction.

2 Qualiﬁed Insertion – Qualiﬁed

We break Qualiﬁed Insertion into two sub-principles for con-
venience in referring to them as follows:4
Vacuity Specialised If y (cid:5)∈ K −
Insertion If y ∈ K −
x , then (K −
Clearly, Vacuity Specialised is not controversial, and our ex-
amination in Example 2 indicates that Insertion is the culprit.
Before we claim what is wrong with Insertion, we digress to
another well known result [G¨ardenfors, 1988](p.65):

x ∩ K −

y , or
x ∩ K −

Given the naming of this principle, it is only appropriate that
we refer to the three “values” of K −
x∧y as the three factors,
here as well as in other variants of this principle below. Not-
ing the logical equivalence between y and (x ∨ y) ∧ (x → y),
and making appropriate substitutions in FACTORING we get:

3. K −

x→y, or
x∨y ∩ K −

From INSERTION and FACTORING 2, in turn, follows the fol-
lowing principle:

quent of the second item as Insertion.

It is our view that FACTORED INSERTION together with
VACUITY SPECIALISED jointly constitute a central principle
for iterated belief contraction. Before arguing our case, we
make the following observation:

Observation 1 INSERTION implies, but is not implied by,
FACTORED INSERTION, in presence of FACTORING 2.

The import of this observation may not be immediately obvi-
ous. How is it that FACTORED INSERTION fails to imply IN-
SERTION in presence of FACTORING 2? The important point
here is which “factor” kicks in when. Let’s continue with our
FIFA example.

a ] = {11, 01}; thus K −

a = Cn(b). Similarly, K −

a→b = Cn(a) = K −
a∨b = Cn(a ↔ b). Note that Since K −

Example 3 Let us model the scenario in Example 2 as fol-
lows. Let the truth vectors 11, 01, 10, 00 represent the four
worlds over the atoms {a, b} (thus 10 is the interpretation
that assigns 1 to a and 0 to b), and 11 < 01 < 10 < 00
where α < β means α is strictly preferred to β. Under
this modelling, min([¬a]) = min(01, 00) = 01 whereby
b =
[K −
Cn(a). More importantly, [K −
a→b] = {11, 10} whereby
K −
a∨b] = {11, 00} whereby
K −
a→b, FAC-
TORING 2 is satisﬁed.5 Similarly, our intuitive expectation,
b = Cn(true) is in accordance with FACTORED
that (K −
a→b = Cn(b) ∩ Cn(a ↔
INSERTION since K −
b) ∩ Cn(a) = Cn(true).6 However, since a ∨ b is in
b but not in Cn(true), INSERTION is not satisﬁed.
K −
INSERTION is not satisﬁed because, while the “third factor”
kicked in to satisfy FACTORED INSERTION, the “second fac-
tor” kicked in to satisfy FACTORING 2.

This example highlights an important point, namely, apart
from factorising iterated contraction as in FACTORED IN-
SERTION, we should also examine the “trigger conditions”
for these factors. Towards this end, we start with FACTOR-
ING, and provide the following result.
Theorem 1 7 Given belief set K, sentences x and y and an
AGM-rational belief contraction operation −,

1. If y ∈ K −
2. If x ∈ K −

Proof Sketch: The third claim easily follows from the AGM
postulates (7−) and (8−). The ﬁrst two claims are symmet-
ric; so it is sufﬁcient to show only claim (1). We use the

of x and y. But that’s not the point we are trying to make here.

6This intuition is, of course, debatable. One might say that since
Brazil has a better track record than Argentina, we should still have
a∨b = Cn(b) ∩ Cn(a ↔
a → b ∈ (K −
b) = Cn(a → b), again is in accord with FACTORED INSERTION.
7Note that the ﬁrst two items are equivalent. We nonetheless
treat them separately since they eventually lead to distinct principles
in PRINCIPLED FACTORED INSERTION below.

standard properties of the epistemic entrenchment relation ≤,
and the well known construction of contraction via it, namely,
x iff both y ∈ K and either that (cid:7) y or x < x ∨ y. We
y ∈ K −
use x < y and x ∼ y as short-hand for (x ≤ y) ∧ (y (cid:5)≤ x) and
(x ≤ y) ∧ (y ≤ x) respectively. We will use ≡ for logical
equivalence. From the assumption y ∈ K −
x∧y, in the prin-
cipal case it follows that x ∧ y < (x ∧ y) ∨ y ≡ y. From
this it follows that (x ∧ y) ∼ x < y. Now consider some
arbitrary sentence z.
x just in case (in the
principal case) x < x ∨ z. Similarly, it will be in K −
x∧y
just in case (in the principal case) x ∧ y < (x ∧ y) ∨ z.
It is sufﬁcient to show that these two conditions are equiv-
alent. (i) Suppose x < x ∨ z. We know x < y where by
x < y ∨ z. Since (x ∧ y) ∨ z ≡ (x ∨ z) ∧ (y ∨ z) and
x ∼ x ∧ y it follows x ∧ y < (x ∧ y) ∨ z. (ii) Suppose
x ∧ y < (x ∧ y) ∨ z ≡ (x ∨ z) ∧ (y ∨ z). It trivially follows
that x < x ∨ z.
Theorem 1 tells us how to reduce contraction by a conjunc-
tion to known contractions by the individual conjuncts. An
immediate corollary of it is applicable to the principle FAC-
TORING 2.

Now, our goal was to examine the conditions that trigger dif-
ferent factors of FACTORED INSERTION. If we qualify each
item in FACTORED INSERTION by the corresponding condi-
tion in Corollary 1 as is:

then, we will be no better off, since it will lead us to all the
problems associated with INSERTION:

Observation 2 NAIVE FACTORED INSERTION is logically
equivalent to INSERTION.

However, we notice that in Theorem 1, in reducing contrac-
tion by a conjunction to contraction by individual conjuncts,
the conditions in question perform a “check” on the result
of the contraction by the conjunction. In FACTORED INSER-
TION, the intention is to reduce iterated contraction to one-
shot contractions. Accordingly we would expect the appro-
priate conditions to perform checks on the result of the se-
quential contraction, not on the result of the one-shot con-
tractions. Accordingly we suggest the following principle in-
stead.

that both b ∈ K −

we consider PRINCIPLED FACTORED INSERTION. Since we
already know that a ∨ b (cid:5)∈ (K −

not apply. So the result of this iterated contraction will cru-
cially depend on whether or not a → b is in (K −
If
a → b ∈ (K −

Note that it is the “slight” difference in the conditions at-
tached to different factors that made the difference. We as-
sumed that a ∈ K −

FACTORED INSERTION, then the the second factor would

have kicked in. But since, by assumption, a ∨ b (cid:5)∈ (K −

in case of PRINCIPLED FACTORED INSERTION, it will be a
factor other than the second one that kicks in, making all the
difference.

3 Some Properties of Principled Iterated

Contraction

We have noticed that PRINCIPLED FACTORED INSERTION
performs reasonably well in our toy example. In this, short,
section we examine some properties that this principle entails.
By a PRINCIPLED ITERATED CONTRACTION OPERA-
TION we understand any AGM-rational contraction opera-
tion that also satisﬁes PRINCIPLED FACTORED INSERTION.
It is understood that such contraction operations will auto-
matically satisfy VACUITY SPECIALISED since, being AGM-
rational, they satisfy VACUITY. We assume in the following
observations that the contraction operation − is a PRINCI-
PLED ITERATED CONTRACTION OPERATION.

Observations 3 and 4 are simple, yet quite interesting.
On the ﬁrst count, they identify conditions under which IN-
SERTION holds in general, i.e., (K −
y is identiﬁed with
K −
y . On the second count, these two properties appear

x ∩ K −

to be the analogues of the ﬁrst two of the four well known
postulates advocated by Darwiche and Pearl [Darwiche and
Pearl, 1997] for iterated belief revision:

If y (cid:7) x then (K ∗

DP 1

y = K ∗
y

Postulates DP1 and DP2 indicate what happens in the case
of iterated revision when the two pieces of evidence x and
y are logically related. The result is given purely in terms
of K ∗
y . Similarly, Observations 3 and 4 tell us what happens
when the two beliefs to be removed, x and y are logically
related. The result is provided purely in terms of K −
x and
K −
y .
Another interesting fact about these two simple obser-
vations is that they record properties of LEXICOGRAPHIC
STATE CONTRACTION introduced in [Nayak et al., 2003].
This suggests a deeper connection between PRINCIPLED IT-
ERATED CONTRACTION and LEXICOGRAPHIC STATE CON-
TRACTION. We take up this issue in the next section.

4 Lexicographic Contraction

the

LEXICOGRAPHIC CONTRACTION is
contraction-
counterpart of of LEXICOGRAPHIC REVISION introduced in
[Nayak, 1994; Nayak et al., 2003]. Like most approaches to
iterated belief change, this approach has been semantically
motivated. In this section we revisit LEXICOGRAPHIC RE-
VISION and LEXICOGRAPHIC CONTRACTION as a prelude
to showing that the iterated belief contraction operation gen-
erated by Lexicographic Contraction must be a PRINCIPLED
ITERATED CONTRACTION operation.

4.1 Lexicographic State Revision
The lexicographic approach to iterated belief revision is cap-
tured by a particular account of state revision [Nayak et al.,
2003]. The semantics of Lexicographic Revision is given in
terms of an evolving belief state, where a belief state is repre-
sented as a plausibility ordering over the interpretations gen-
erated by the background language.
Deﬁnition 1 Let Ω be the set of possible worlds (interpreta-
tions) of the background language L, and (cid:16) a total preorder
(a connected, transitive and reﬂexive relation) over Ω. For
any set Σ ⊆ Ω and world ω ∈ Ω we will say ω is a (cid:16)-
minimal member of Σ if and only if both ω ∈ Σ and ω (cid:16) ω(cid:7)
for all ω(cid:7) ∈ Σ, and denote it as ω ∈ min(cid:8)(Σ). We will often
drop the parentheses for readability.

By ω1 (cid:16) ω2 we will understand that ω2 is not more plausi-
ble than ω1. The expression ω1 ≡ ω2 will be used as a short-
hand for (ω1 (cid:16) ω2 and ω2 (cid:16) ω1). The symbol < will denote
the strict part of (cid:16). For any set S ⊆ L we will denote by [S]
the set {ω ∈ Ω | ω |= s for every s ∈ S }. For readability, we
will abbreviate [{s}] to [s]. Intuitively, the preorder (cid:16) will
be the semantic analogue of the revision operation ∗, and will
represent the belief state of an agent. We will say that K(cid:8) is
the belief set associated with the preorder (cid:16). It is deﬁned as
the set of sentences satisﬁed by the (cid:16)-minimal worlds, i.e.

K(cid:8) = {x ∈ L | ω |= x for all ω ∈ min(cid:8)(Ω)}.

An inconsistent belief state is represented by an empty rela-
tion (cid:16)⊥: for every pair ω, ω(cid:7) ∈ Ω, ω (cid:5)(cid:16)⊥ ω(cid:7). Note that this

IJCAI-07

violates connectedness, and hence the plausibility relation (cid:16)
is, strictly speaking, no longer a total preorder. However, this
is a special case, and merits special treatment.

A modiﬁed Grove-Construction [Grove, 1988] is used to

construct the revision from a given plausibility relation:
(cid:2)
Deﬁnition 2 ((cid:16) to *)

x ∈ K ∗(cid:2)

e

iff

[e] ⊆ [x]
min(cid:8)[e] ⊆ [x]

if (cid:16) = (cid:16)⊥
otherwise.

The plausibility ordering (belief state) (cid:16), in light of new ev-
idence e, is stipulated to evolve to the new ordering (cid:16)(cid:2)
e via
the use of a state revision operator (cid:2) as follows.

1. SPECIAL CASES:

(a) If [e] = ∅ then, and only then, (cid:16)(cid:2)
(b) Else, if (cid:16) = (cid:16)⊥,

e =(cid:16)⊥

then ω1 (cid:16)(cid:2)

e ω2 iff either ω1 |= e or ω2 |= ¬e.

2. GENERAL CASE: Given nonempty prior ((cid:16)(cid:5)=(cid:16)⊥) and

satisﬁable evidence([e] (cid:5)= ∅),

4.2 Lexicographic Contraction

As in the case of lexicographic revision, we take it that the
pre-contraction plausibility ordering (belief state) (cid:16), after
suspension of belief x, evolves to the new ordering (cid:16)(cid:10)
x via
the use of a state contraction operator (cid:18) as follows.
Deﬁnition 3 (Lexicographic State Contraction (cid:18))

1. SPECIAL CASES:

(a) ((cid:16)(cid:6))(cid:10)
(b) ((cid:16)⊥)(cid:10)

x =(cid:16)(cid:6) for all x.
x =(cid:16)(cid:6) for all x.

2. GENERAL CASE: Given non-trivial pre-contraction

state (cid:16), (cid:16)⊥(cid:5)=(cid:16)(cid:5)=(cid:16)(cid:6),
(a) If ω |= x and ω(cid:7) |= x then ω (cid:16)(cid:10)
x ω(cid:7)
(b) If ω |= ¬x and ω(cid:7) |= ¬x then ω (cid:16)(cid:10)
iff ω (cid:16) ω(cid:7)
(c) Let χ ∈ {x, ¬x} and χ be its complement. If ω |=
χ and ω(cid:7) |= χ, then ω (cid:16)(cid:10)
iff for every chain
ω0 < ω1 < · · · < ω in [χ] of length n, there exists
a chain ω(cid:7)

of length n in [χ].

1 < · · · < ω(cid:7)

iff ω (cid:16) ω(cid:7)

0 < ω(cid:7)

x ω(cid:7)

x ω(cid:7)

Corresponding conditions 2(a) and 2(b) in LEXICOGRAPHIC
REVISION and LEXICOGRAPHIC CONTRACTION are more
or less identical: irrespective of whether x is a piece of ev-
idence to be incorporated into the current knowledge corpus
(or a belief to be suspended) the prior ordering between any
two worlds, ω and ω(cid:7) that both satisfy x (or both invalidate
x), should not be disturbed in the process. These conditions
are also accepted in the Darwiche-Pearl approach to belief
revision. Condition 2(c) in LEXICOGRAPHIC CONTRAC-
TION states the effect of a contraction by x on two worlds,
one of which satisﬁes x and the other does not:
the rank-
ing of all worlds in [¬x] are simultaneously shifted so that
the best (minimal) worlds in [¬x] attain the same rank as

the (cid:16)-minimal worlds (i.e., the worlds in [K]). This is rem-
iniscent of Spohn’s account of belief contraction via Ordinal
Conditional Functions [Spohn, 1988], and we take it that this
is the relational analogue of Spohn’s account of iterated be-
lief contraction. This deﬁnition of (cid:18) captures in a simple
way a generalised version of the Harper Identity provided in
[Nayak et al., 2006].

tion of lexicographic state contraction. The “state space” Ω
is partitioned by the pre-contraction plausibility preorder (cid:16)
into eight “cells”, 0, 1, . . . 7, the worlds in i being preferable
to those in i + 1, for 0 ≤ i ≤ 6, while the worlds in the same
cell are equally preferable. These cells are further partitioned
by [x] and [¬x]: the cells X0, . . . , X7 constituting [x], and the
cells Y0, . . . , Y4 constituting [¬x]. After the contraction by x,
the “best” worlds in [x] as well as the “best” worlds in[¬x]
are accorded the most preferred status in the post-contraction
state; the second most preferred worlds consisting of the pre-
contraction “next best” worlds from [x] and [¬x], and so on.
Earlier we indicated that there is a close connection be-
tween Lexicographic Contraction and Principled Iterated
Contraction. For this purpose we need to generate a contrac-
tion operation from a given plausibility preorder in order to
make this connection. We use a slight variation of the stan-
dard transformation.

Our last result (Theorem 2) below shows that if the two se-
quential contractions in (K −
y are constructed from the be-
lief states (cid:16) and (cid:16)(cid:10)
x respectively, where K is the belief set
K(cid:8) associated with the belief state (cid:16), then PRINCIPLED
FACTORED INSERTION is satisﬁed.
Theorem 2 Let (cid:16) be the original belief state, K its associ-
ated belief set K(cid:8), and (cid:18) the lexicographic state contraction
operation. If we deﬁne, for every sentence α and β,

Proof Sketch: Note that, given a preorder (cid:16) and sentence
x , denoted (cid:16)(cid:7) below for readability, is a total
x, we have (cid:16)(cid:10)
preorder. Hence the operation −((cid:8)(cid:10)x), deﬁned as required, is
an AGM-rational belief contraction operation. A point to be
noted is that the two contraction operations in an expression
of the form (K −
y are technically different operations, the
ﬁrst corresponding to − := −(cid:8) and the second to −(cid:7)
:= −(cid:8)(cid:3) ,
x )−(cid:3)
and so it should more accurately be represented as (K −
y .8
We need to show that the operation pair (−, −(cid:7)) satisﬁes
the property PRINCIPLED FACTORED INSERTION. It is eas-
ily shown that in presence of the condition y ∈ K −
x , the con-
ditions

x )−

1. x → y ∈ (K −
2. x ∨ y ∈ (K −
3. the two conditions x → y (cid:5)∈ (K −

x )−(cid:3)
y amounts to min(cid:8)(cid:3)[¬y] ⊆ [¬x]
x )−(cid:3)
y amounts to min(cid:8)(cid:3)[¬y] ⊆ [x], and

and x ∨ y (cid:5)∈
y jointly amount to ∃ ω, ω(cid:7) ∈ min(cid:8)(cid:3)[¬y] s.t. ω ∈

x )−(cid:3)

x )−(cid:3)

y

(K −
[x] and ω(cid:7) ∈ [¬x].

Note that these three cases are mutually exclusive, and it suf-
ﬁces in these cases to show respectively that

A min(cid:8)(cid:3)[¬y] = min(cid:8)([¬x] ∩ [¬y])
B min(cid:8)(cid:3)[¬y] = min(cid:8)([x] ∩ [¬y])
C min(cid:8)(cid:3)[¬y] = min(cid:8)([¬x] ∩ [¬y]) ∪ min(cid:8)([x] ∩ [¬y])
The information contained in (1), (2) and (3), together with
the deﬁnition of the operation (cid:18), in particular, that the relative
ordering of worlds inside [x] (respectively [¬x]) is not dis-
turbed, help to carry out the proofs of (A), (B) and (C), corre-
spondingly. For instance, the fact from (1), that min(cid:8)(cid:3)[¬y] ⊆
[¬x] and the condition that for ω, ω(cid:7) ∈ [¬x], ω (cid:16)(cid:7) ω(cid:7) iff ω (cid:16)
ω(cid:7) drive the proof of (A).

A point to note that the condition (2c) in Deﬁnition 3 is not

used in the proof.

A natural question to raise at this point is whether the prop-
erty PRINCIPLED FACTORED INSERTION, together with the
AGM postulates of contraction, fully characterises Lexico-
graphic Contraction.
It is easily veriﬁed that it does not.
Given y ∈ K −
x∨y when
x∨y when (cid:5)(cid:7) x → y otherwise,
(cid:5)(cid:7) x ∨ y, and with K −
it will satisfy PRINCIPLED FACTORED INSERTION, and yet
a non-Lexicographic state contraction operation, PRIORITY,9
will lead to such contraction behaviour.
5 Conclusion
Our aim was to examine iterated belief contraction in a prin-
cipled way. We started with Rott’s QUALIFIED INSERTION
that, upon examination, was found to be wanting. We then
showed that a judicious combination of QUALIFIED INSER-
TION with FACTORING leads to what we consider to be a piv-
otal principle of iterated belief change. We have argued that

8See the dynamics of revision operations in [Nayak et al., 2003]

for motivation.

9See [Nayak et al., 2006]. This can be pictured as a variation of
Figure 1 where in the post-contraction state, Y0, . . . , Y4 get the ranks
0, . . . , 4; X0 retains rank 0, and X1, . . . , X7 get ranks 5, . . . , 11.
That is, every non-best world in [x] is dis-preferred to every world
in [¬x], subject to other relevant conditions.

while Lexicographic State Contraction satisﬁes it, this princi-
ple is too weak to completely characterise a Lexicographic
Contraction. We hope to completely characterise Lexico-
graphic Contraction in our future work.
