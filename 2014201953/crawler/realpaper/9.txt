Abstract

In this paper, we investigate the relationship be-
tween two prioritized knowledge bases by measur-
ing both the conﬂict and the agreement between
them. First of all, a quantity of conﬂict and two
quantities of agreement are deﬁned. The former is
shown to be a generalization of the Dalal distance.
The latter are, respectively, a quantity of strong
agreement which measures the amount of infor-
mation on which two belief bases “totally” agree,
and a quantity of weak agreement which measures
the amount of information that is believed by one
source but is unknown to the other. All three quan-
tity measures are based on the weighted prime im-
plicant, which represents beliefs in a prioritized be-
lief base. We then deﬁne a degree of conﬂict and
two degrees of agreement based on our quantity of
conﬂict and the quantities of agreement. We also
consider the impact of these measures on belief
merging and information source ordering.

Introduction

1
In the belief revision and belief merging literature, the well-
known Dalal distance known as the Hamming distance be-
tween interpretations [Dalal, 1988], plays a key role in the
notion of minimal change. The Dalal distance between two
interpretations models how many atoms are in conﬂict, so it
measures only the quantity of conﬂict between them. Hunter
has deﬁned a degree of conﬂict between two knowledge bases
based on the Dalal distance [Hunter, 2004].

In recent years, relationships between two knowledge
bases have been deﬁned by measures of information and con-
tradiction. In [Konieczny et al., 2003], a degree of contra-
diction and a degree of ignorance were deﬁned and they can
be used to order the sources of information. If a knowledge
base has a high degree of contradiction and a low degree of
ignorance, then it has a low order. In [Hunter, 2002], some
compromise relations between two knowledge bases were de-
ﬁned according to the quantities of conﬂict information and
total information in them.

In all the relationships described above, the quantity of
conﬂict information between two knowledge bases was fo-
cused upon. However, in reality, when establishing the rela-

tionships between two agents, not only information in con-
ﬂict, but also information in agreement should be considered.
The quantities of conﬂict and agreement can affect each other.
Considering two agents with low quantity of conﬂict between
them, our perception of the degree of conﬂict between them
will be further weakened if they have a lot in common. Fur-
thermore, when two agents have no information in conﬂict, it
is useful to consider the agreement between them.

We use two quantities of agreement; one is called the quan-
tity of strong agreement which measures the information that
both agents “totally” agree with, and the other is called the
quantity of weak agreement which measures the information
that is believed by one source but is unknown to the other.
Both quantities will inﬂuence the degree of conﬂict, but their
inﬂuences are different.
Intuitively, the quantity of strong
agreement will have more inﬂuence on the degree of conﬂict
than the quantity of weak agreement. To illustrate, let us con-
sider the following three knowledge bases: B1 = {φ, ψ},
B2 = {¬φ, ψ}, and B3 = {¬φ}. B1 is in conﬂict with
both B2 and B3. B1 and B2 strongly agree on ψ, whilst
B1 only weakly agrees with B3 on ψ. Clearly the degree
of conﬂict between B1 and B2 should be smaller than that
between B1 and B3 because there is a topic that both B1 and
B2 agree opon. However, when deﬁning the degree of con-
ﬂict [Hunter, 2004], Hunter did not distinguish the inﬂuences
of strong agreement and weak agreement. To accompany the
degree of conﬂict, we can deﬁne a degree of strong agreement
and a degree of weak agreement.

In this paper, we will measure the conﬂict and agreement
between two prioritized knowledge bases, where the pri-
ority of a formula, based on necessity degrees, is handled
in possibilistic logic.
It is well-known that priority plays
an important role in inconsistency handling, belief revision
and belief merging [G¨ardenfors, 1988; Konieczny & Ramon,
1998; Benferhat et al., 2002]. Possibilistic logic provides a
good framework for expressing priority. We ﬁrst deﬁne the
weighted prime implicant (WPI), which is a generalization of
the regular prime implicant to possibilistic logic. Then, the
measures of conﬂict and agreement will be deﬁned by WPIs.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives some
preliminaries. We then deﬁne the weighted prime implicant
and measures of conﬂict and agreement in Section 3. Sec-
tion 4 discusses the impact of the measures of conﬂict and
agreement. Finally we conclude the paper in Section 5.

2 Preliminaries
Classical logic: In this paper, we consider a propositional
language LP S from a ﬁnite set P S of propositional symbols.
The classical consequence relation is denoted as `. An inter-
pretation is a total function from P S to {true, f alse}. Ω is
the set of all possible interpretations. An interpretation w is
a model of a formula φ iff w(φ) = true. p, q, r,... represent
atoms in P S. A literal is an atom p or its negation ¬p. We will
denote literals by l, l1, .. and formulae in LP S by φ, ψ, γ,...
For each formula φ, we use M (φ) to denote its set of models.
A classical knowledge base B is a ﬁnite set of propositional
formulae. B is consistent iff there exists an interpretation w
such that w(φ) = true for all φ∈B. A clause C is a disjunc-
tion of literals: C = l1∨...∨ln and its dual clause, or term D,
is a conjunction of literals: D = l1∧...∧ln.
Possibilistic Logic [Dubois et al., 1994]: Possibilistic logic
is a weighted logic where each classical logic formula is asso-
ciated with a number in [0, 1], a necessity degree, which rep-
resents the extent to which the formula is true. A possibilistic
knowledge base (PKB) is the set of possibilistic formulae of
the form B = {(φi, αi) : i = 1, ..., n}. Possibilistic formula
(φi, αi) means that the necessity degree of φi is at least equal
to αi. A classical knowledge base B = {φi : i = 1, ..., n}
corresponds to a PKB B0 = {(φi, 1) : i = 1, ..., n}. In this
paper, we consider only PKBs where every formula φ is a
classical propositional formula. The classical base associated
with B is denoted as B∗, namely B∗ = {φi|(φi, αi) ∈ B}.
A PKB is consistent iff its classical base is consistent.

Semantically, the most basic and important notion is pos-
sibility distribution π: Ω → [0, 1]. π(ω) represents the
possibility degree of interpretation ω with available beliefs.
From possibility distribution π, two measures can be deter-
mined, one is the possibility degree of formula φ, deﬁned as
Π(φ) = max{π(ω) : ω |= φ}, the other is the necessity
degree of formula φ, deﬁned as N (φ) = 1 − Π(¬φ). The
possibility measure is max-decomposable, i.e. Π(φ ∨ ψ) =
max(Π(φ), Π(ψ)). Whilst the necessity measure is min-
decomposable, i.e. N (φ ∧ ψ) = min(N (φ), Π(ψ)).

Deﬁnition 1 [Dubois et al., 1994] Let B be a PKB,
The α-cut of B is B≥α =
and α ∈ [0, 1].
{φ∈B∗|(φ, a)∈B and a≥α}.
Deﬁnition 2 [Dubois et al., 1994] Let B be a PKB. A for-
mula φ is said to be a possibilistic consequence of B to de-
gree a, denoted by B`π(φ, a), iff the following conditions
hold: (1) B≥a is consistent; (2) B≥a`φ; (3) ∀b>a, B≥b 6` φ.

3 Measures of Conﬂicts and Agreements
3.1 Weighted prime implicant
In this section, we will deﬁne and discuss weighted prime
implicants of PKBs.

A term D is an implicant of formula φ iff D`φ and D does

not contain two complementary literals.

Deﬁnition 3 [Cadoli & Donini, 1997] A prime implicant of
knowledge base B is an implicant D of B such that for every
other implicant D0 of B, D6`D0.

Prime implicants are often used in knowledge compilation
[Cadoli & Donini, 1997] to make the deduction tractable.
Suppose D1, ..., Dk are all the prime implicants of B, we
have B`φ, for any φ iff for every prime implicant Di, Di`φ.
Now we deﬁne weighted prime implicants of a PKB. Let
us ﬁrst deﬁne weighted prime implicants for PKB B =
{(φ1, a1), ..., (φn, an)} where φi are clauses. For a more
general PKB, we can decompose it to an equivalent PKB
whose formulae are clauses by the min-decomposability of
necessity measures, i.e., N (∧i=1,kφi)≥m⇔∀i, N (φi)≥m.

Let B = {(φ1, a1), ..., (φn, an)} be a PKB where
φi are clauses. A weighted implicant of B is D =
{(ψ1, b1), ..., (ψk, bk)}, a PKB, such that D `π B, where
ψi are literals. Let D and D0 be two weighted implicants of
B, D is said to be more speciﬁc than D0 iff D6=D0, D0∗⊆D∗
and ∀(ψi, ai)∈D, ∃(ψi, bi)∈D0 with bi≤ai.
Deﬁnition 4 Let B = {(φ1, a1), ..., (φn, an)} be a PKB
where φi are clauses. A weighted prime implicant (WPI) of
B is D such that

1. D is a weighted implicant of B
2.

6 ∃ D0 of B such that D is more speciﬁc than D0.

Let us look at an example to illustrate how to construct

WPIs.
Example 1 Let B = {(p, 0.8), (q∨r, 0.5), (q ∨ ¬s, 0.6)} be
a PKB. The WPIs of B are D1 = {(p, 0.8), (q, 0.6)},
D2
=
{(p, 0.8), (q, 0.5), (¬s, 0.6)}.

{(p, 0.8), (r, 0.5), (¬s, 0.6)},

and D3

=

The WPI generalizes the prime implicant.

Proposition 1 Let B = {(φ1, 1), ..., (φn, 1)} be a PKB
which contains formulae with weight 1, i.e., B is a classi-
cal knowledge base. Then D is a WPI of B iff D is a prime
implicant of B.

However, given PKB B, if D is a WPI of B, then D∗ is
not necessarily a prime implicant of B∗. A counterexample
can be found in Example 1, where D3 is a WPI, but D∗
3 =
{p, q, ¬s} is not a prime implicant of B∗.

The following proposition says that WPIs can be used to

compile a PKB.
Proposition 2 Let B be a PKB. If D1,...,Dn are all the WPIs
of B, then for any formula φ, we have,

B`π(φ, a) if f Di`π(φ, a), f or all Di.

Next we give some justiﬁcation for the WPI.
First of all, to measure information in a single classical
knowledge base (this knowledge base may be inconsistent),
most of the current methods are based on the models of the
knowledge base [Hunter, 2002; Lozinskii, 1994]. In [Hunter,
2002], the degree of inconsistency is measured based on the
model of an inconsistent knowledge base in the framework
of quasi-classical logic. In [Lozinskii, 1994], a quasi-model
of an inconsistent knowledge base, which is a maximal con-
sistent subbase of the knowledge base, is deﬁned to mea-
sure information for inconsistent sets. By Deﬁnition 4, each
WPI can be interpreted as a partial truth assignment. Sup-
pose p is an atom and D is a WPI, then (p, a)∈D means

that there is an argument for p in D with certainty degree
a, and (¬p, b)∈D means that there is an argument against p
in D with certainty degree b, while φ6∈D∗ means the truth
value of φ is undetermined in D. By Proposition 2, a WPI
can be viewed as a partial model of a possibilistic knowledge
base. This is consistent with the methods in [Hunter, 2002;
Lozinskii, 1994].

Second, when all the formulae in a PKB have the same
weight 1, a WPI is a prime implicant. In classical logic, a
classical model is often used to deﬁne the distance between
two knowledge bases [Dalal, 1988]. However, classical mod-
els are not suitable for us to deﬁne the quantities of agreement
between knowledge bases because a classical model must as-
sign a truth value to every atom in the knowledge bases. Let
us look at the example in the introduction again. The only
model for B1 is w = {φ, ψ} and there are two models for
B3, i.e., w1 = {¬φ, ψ} and w2 = {¬φ, ¬ψ}. B1 and B3
weakly agree on ψ because only B1 supports ψ. However,
by comparing w with w1 or comparing w with w2 we cannot
get such a conclusion. In contrast, a prime implicant can be
viewed as a partial truth assignment. That is, only some of
the atoms are assigned truth values. Given a prime implicant
D of B, a three-value semantics can be associated with it as
follows:

vD(p) =(

true
f alse

if D ` p,
if D ` ¬p,

undetermined otherwise.

In the example, B1 has one prime implicant D1 = {φ, ψ}
and B3 has one prime implicant D2 = {¬φ}, where D2 does
not contain any information on ψ; so the quantity of weak
agreement between D1 and D2 is 1. As a consequence, the
weak agreement between B1 and B3 is 1, which is consistent
with our analysis above.

3.2 Quantity of conﬂict and quantities of

agreement

In this section, we will measure the quantities of conﬂict and
agreement between two PKBs based on the WPI.

First we deﬁne the quantity of conﬂict between two WPIs.
Deﬁnition 5 Let B1 and B2 be two PKBs. Suppose C and
D are WPIs of B1 and B2 respectively, then the quantity of
conﬂict between C and D is deﬁned as

qCon(C, D) =

X

(p,a)∈C and (¬p,b)∈D

min(a, b).

(2)

When all the weights are 1, qCon(C, D) is the cardinality of
the set of atoms which are in conﬂict in C∪D.
Deﬁnition 6 Let B1 and B2 be two PKBs. Suppose C and
D are the sets of WPIs of B1 and B2 respectively, then the
quantity of conﬂict between B1 and B2 is deﬁned as

QCon(B1, B2) = min{qCon(C, D)|C∈C, D∈D}.

(3)

The quantity of conﬂict between B1 and B2 measures the
minimum amount of information in conﬂict between them.
Example 2 Let B1 = {(¬p, 0.8), (¬q ∨ r, 0.6)} and
B2 = {(p ∨ ¬r, 0.7), (q, 0.5)} be two PKBs.
The

(1)

QCon(B1, B2) = Dalal(B1, B2).

WPIs of B1 are C1 = {(¬p, 0.8), (¬q, 0.6)} and C2 =
{(¬p, 0.8), (r, 0.6)}, and the WPIs of B2 are D1 =
{(p, 0.7), (q, 0.5)} and D2 = {(¬r, 0.7), (q, 0.5)}. It is easy
to calculate that qCon(C1, D1) = 1.2, qCon(C1, D2) =
0.5, qCon(C2, D1) = 0.7, qCon(C2, D2) = 0.6. Therefore,
the quantity of conﬂict between B1 and B2 is 0.5.
Proposition 3 Let B, B1 and B2 be three PKBs. If B1⊆B2,
then QCon(B, B1) ≤QCon(B, B2).
Proposition 3 tells us that the quantity of conﬂict between two
PKBs will increase (not strictly) when one of them has some
new information added.

Let X be a set of classical propositional formulae. Let
I(X) be the set of interpretations of X delineated by the
atoms used in X (i.e. I(X) = 2Atoms(X), where Atom(X)
denotes the set of atoms appearing in X). Let M (X, Y )
be the set of models of X that are in I(Y ). That is,
M (X, Y ) = {w|=∧X|w∈I(Y )}. The Dalal distance [Dalal,
1988] between two models wi, wj of a classical formula is
the Hamming distance between them, i.e., Dalal(wi, wj) =
|wi − wj| + |wj − wi|.
Proposition 4 Let B1 and B2 be two consistent clas-
sical knowledge bases.
Let Dalal (B1, B2) = min
{Dalal(wi, wj)|wi∈M (B1, B1∪B2), wj∈M (B2, B1∪B2)}.
Then we have

Proposition 4 is very important, because it reveals that our
quantity of conﬂict coincides with the Dalal distance in clas-
sical logic. Therefore, the quantity of conﬂict QCon(B1, B2)
can be taken as a generalization of the Dalal distance.
Deﬁnition 7 Let B1 and B2 be two PKBs. Suppose C and
D are WPIs of B1 and B2 respectively, then the quantity of
strong agreement between C and D is deﬁned as

qSA(C, D) = X(p,a)∈C, (p,b)∈D

min(a, b),

(4)

When all the weights are 1, qCon(C, D) is the cardinality of
the set of literals that are in both C and D.
Deﬁnition 8 Let B1 and B2 be two PKBs. Suppose C and
D are the sets of WPIs of B1 and B2 respectively, then the
quantity of strong agreement between B1 and B2 is deﬁned
as

QSA(B1, B2) = max{qSA(C, D)|C∈C, D∈D}.

(5)
The quantity of strong agreement between B1 and B2 mea-
sures how much information is supported by both B1 and B2.
Example 3 (Continue Example 2) By Equation 4, we have
qSA(C1, D1) = qSA(C1, D2) = 0 and qSA(C2, D1) =
qSA(C2, D2) = 0. Therefore, the quantity of strong agree-
ment between B1 and B2 is QSA(B1, B2) = 0.
Deﬁnition 9 Let B1 and B2 be two PKBs. Suppose C and
D are WPIs of B1 and B2 respectively, then the quantity of
weak agreement between C and D is deﬁned as

qW A(C, D) =

(pi,ai)∈C∪D,pi6∈C ∗∩D∗ and ¬pi6∈C ∗∪D∗

X

ai.

(6)

When all the weights are 1, qCon(C, D) is the cardinality of
the set of literals which are in only one of C or D.
Deﬁnition 10 Let B1 and B2 be two PBKs. Suppose C and
D are the sets of WPIs of B1 and B2 respectively, then the
quantity of weak agreement between B1 and B2 is deﬁned as
(7)

QW A(B1, B2) = max{qW A(C, D)|C∈C, D∈D}.

The quantity of weak agreement between B1 and B2 mea-
sures the information supported by only one knowledge base
and unknown to the other.
Example 4 (Continue Example 2) By Equation 6, we
have qW A(C1, D1) = 0, qW A(C1, D2) = 1.5, and
qW A(C2, D1) = 1.1, qW A(C2, D2) = 1.3. Therefore,
the quantity of weak agreement between B1 and B2 is
QW A(B1, B2) = 1.5.

The function QW A is not monotonic with regard to the sub-

set relation, as shown below
Example 5 Let B1 = {(p, 1)} and B2 = {(q, 1)}, then
QW A(B1, B2) = 2. However, the quantity of weak agree-
ment between B3 = {(p, 1), (p → ¬q, 1)} and B2 is
QW A(B2, B3) = 1, where B1⊆B3.

Based on the quantity of conﬂict and quantities of agree-
ment, we can deﬁne the following relationships between two
knowledge bases B1 and B2 as

• B1

and B2

iff Qc(B1, B2)
QW A(B1, B2) = 0.

are said to be totally in conﬂict
=

0 and QSA(B1, B2)

>

• B1 and B2 are totally in agreement iff QCon(B1, B2) =

QW A(B1, B2) = 0 and QSA(B1, B2) > 0.

• B1 and B2 are partially in conﬂict iff QCon(B1, B2) >

0 and QSA(B1, B2) + QW A(B1, B2) > 0.

3.3 Degree of conﬂict and degrees of agreement
In this subsection, we will deﬁne a degree of conﬂict and two
degrees of agreement between two PKBs. The degree of con-
ﬂict measures the extent to which two knowledge bases are in
conﬂict. It was ﬁrst introduced in [Hunter, 2004] to measure
the believability of arguments.
Deﬁnition 11 Let B1 and B2 be two self-consistent knowl-
edge bases, and Dalal(B1, B2) be the Dalal distance be-
tween B1 and B2. The degree of conﬂict between B1 and
B2, denoted as C(B1, B2), is deﬁned as follows:

C(B1, B2) =

Dalal(B1, B2)
log2(|I(B1∪B2)|

(8)

Although this deﬁnition gives a method to measure the de-
gree of conﬂict, it can sometimes overestimate the degree of
conﬂict between two knowledge bases, because it doesn’t dis-
tinguish the inﬂuences of strong agreement and weak agree-
ment. For example, let us consider two pairs of knowl-
1, B2), where B1 = {p, q, r},
edge bases (B1, B2) and (B0
B2 = {¬p, q, r} and B0
1 = {p}. Although the quantity of
conﬂict between B1 and B2 is 1, the quantity of strongly
agreement between them is 2. This means B1 and B2 have
more in agreement than in conﬂict. In contrast, although the

1, B2) = 0 and DW A(B0

1 and B2 is also 1, but with
quantity of conﬂict between B0
1, B2) = 2, the degree of
DSA(B0
conﬂict between B0
1 and B2 should be higher than that be-
tween B1 and B2. However, by Equation 8, C(B1, B2) =
C(B0

1, B2) = 1/3. This is not reasonable.

We propose the following revised deﬁnition of the degree

of conﬂict.

Deﬁnition 12 Let B1 and B2 be two PKBs. Let C and D be
WPIs of B1 and B2 respectively. AtomC(C, D) denotes the
cardinality of the set of atoms which are in conﬂict in C∪D.
Then the degree of conﬂict between C and D is deﬁned as

,

qCon(C, D)

dCon(C, D) =

AtomC(C, D) + qSA(C, D) + λqW A(C, D)
(9)
where λ ∈ (0, 1] is used to weaken the inﬂuence of the quan-
tity of weak agreement on the degree of conﬂict. In the fol-
lowing, we always assume that λ = 0.5, that is, the quantity
of weak agreement only has “half” as much the inﬂuence on
the degree of conﬂict as the quantity of strong agreement.
Deﬁnition 13 Let B1 and B2 be two PKBs. Suppose C and
D are the sets of WPIs of B1 and B2 respectively, then the
degree of conﬂict between B1 and B2 is deﬁned as

DCon(B1, B2) = min{dCon(C, D)|C∈C, D∈D}.

(10)

The advantage of our degree of conﬂict can be seen from

the following example.

Example 6 Let us consider a dialogue between three peo-
ple John, Mary, and Gary. They are discussing “whether
Italy is the best football team in the world ”(p) and “whether
the best forwards are in Brazil” (q).
John says “I think
Italy is the best football team in the world and the best
forwards are in Brazil”, Mary says “No, I think France is
the best team, but I agree with you that the best forwards
are in Brazil”, and Gary says “No, I think France is the
best team”. So the knowledge bases are John = {p, q},
M ary = {¬p, q} and Gary = {¬p}. By Equation 8, we
have C(John, M ary) = C(John, Gary) = 1/2. This is
not reasonable, because John and Mary agree on q, the de-
gree of conﬂict between them should be less than the degree
of conﬂict between John and Gary.
In contrast, we have
Dc(John, M ary) = 1/2 and DCon(John, Gary) = 2/3,
so Dc(John, M ary) < Dc(John, Gary).
Proposition 5 Let B1, B2 be two classical knowledge bases.
Suppose C(B1, B2) and DCon(B1, B2) are the degrees of
conﬂict deﬁned by Deﬁnition 11 and Deﬁnition 13 respec-
tively. Then C(B1, B2)≥DCon(B1, B2).

Similarly, we can deﬁne the degree of strong agreement.
We hold that the inﬂuence of the quantity of conﬂict on the
degree of strong agreement is more than that of the quantity
of weak agreement.

Deﬁnition 14 Let B1 and B2 be two PKBs. Let C and D be
WPIs of B1 and B2 respectively. AtomSA(C, D) denotes the
cardinality of the set of atoms which are included in both C
and D. Then the degree of strong agreement between C and

D is deﬁned as

dSA(C, D) =

qSA(C, D)

AtomSA(C, D) + qCon(C, D) + λqW A(C, D)

(11)
where λ ∈ (0, 1] is used to weaken the inﬂuence of the quan-
tity of weak agreement on the degree of conﬂict. As in Deﬁni-
tion 12, we usually take λ = 0.5.
Deﬁnition 15 Let B1 and B2 be two PKBs. Suppose C and
D are the sets of weighted prime implicants of B1 and B2
respectively, then the degree of strong agreement between B1
and B2 is deﬁned as

DSA(B1, B2) = max{dSA(C, D)|C∈C, D∈D}.

(12)
Example 7 Let B1 = {(p, 0.8), (q ∨ r, 0.4), (p → s, 0.5)}
and B2 = {(p ∨ ¬r, 0.8), (q, 0.6), (¬s, 0.7)}.
The
WPIs of B1 are C1 = {(p, 0.8), (q, 0.4), (s, 0.5)} and
C2 = {(p, 0.8), (r, 0.4), (s, 0.5)}, and the WPIs of
B2 are D1 = {(p, 0.8), (q, 0.6), (¬s, 0.7)} and D2 =
{(¬r, 0.8), (q, 0.6), (¬s, 0.7)}.
So dSA(C1, D1) = 0.48,
dSA(C1, D2) = 0.17, dSA(C2, D1) = 0.4, dSA(C2, D2) =
0. Therefore, DSA(B1, B2) = 0.48.

The degrees of conﬂict and strong agreement are related to

each other.
Proposition 6 Let B1 and B2 be two PKBs. Then their de-
gree of conﬂict and degree of strong agreement cannot be
greater than 0.5 at the same time, i.e., if DCon(B1, B2) >
0.5, then DSA(B1, B2)≤0.5.

We can also deﬁne the degree of weak agreement.

Deﬁnition 16 Let B1 and B2 be two PKBs. Let C and D be
WPIs of B1 and B2 respectively. AtomW A(C, D) denotes
the cardinality of the set of atoms which are included in only
one of C and D but not both. Then the degree of weak agree-
ment between C and D is deﬁned as

qW A(C, D)

dW A(C, D) =

AtomW A(C, D) + qCon(C, D) + qSA(C, D)
(13)
In Deﬁnition 16, the quantity of conﬂict and quantity of
strong agreement have the same inﬂuence on the degree of
weak agreement. When both B1 and B2 are classical knowl-
edge bases, we have dW A(C, D) = AtomW A(C,D)
|Atom(C∪D)| .
Deﬁnition 17 Let B1 and B2 be two PKBs. Suppose C and
D are the sets of WPIs of B1 and B2 respectively, then the
degree of weak agreement between B1 and B2 is deﬁned as

DW A(B1, B2) = max{dW A(C, D)|C∈C, D∈D}.

(14)
Example 8 (Continue Example 7) By Deﬁnition 16, we have
dW A(C1, D1) = 0, dW A(C1, D2) = 0.55, dW A(C2, D1) =
0.3, dW A(C2, D2) = 0.48. So the degree of weak agreement
between B1 and B2 is 0.55.
Proposition 7 Let B1 and B2 be two possibilistic knowledge
bases. If dW A(B1, B2) > 0.5, then dCon(B1, B2) < 0.5 and
dSA(B1, B2) < 0.5.
Proposition 7 shows that if the degree of weak agreement be-
tween two knowledge bases is large, i.e., greater than 0.5,
then both the degree of conﬂict and degree of strong agree-
ment between them should be small, i.e., less than 0.5.

Impact of Measures of Conﬂict and
Agreement

4.1 Choice of combination operators
Many operators have been proposed for merging PKBs.
Given two PKBs B1 and B2 with possibility distributions πB1
and πB2 respectively, the semantic results of their combina-
tion by a T-norm tn and a T-conorm ct are

∀ω, πtn(ω) = tn(πB1 (ω), πB2 (ω)),
∀ω, πct(ω) = ct(πB1(ω), πB2 (ω)).

(15)
(16)
The syntactic results associated with πtn and πct are respec-
tively the following PKBs [Benferhat et al., 2002]:
Btn = B1 ∪ B2 ∪ {(φi ∨ ψj, ct(αi, βj))|(φi, αi) ∈ B1
(17)

and (ψj, βj) ∈ B2},

Bct = {(φi ∨ ψj, tn(αi, βj))|(φi, αi) ∈ B1

,

and (ψj, βj) ∈ B2}.

(18)
If we require that the result of the combination be a consistent
knowledge base, then the T-norm based operator cannot be
used when there is a conﬂict between B1 and B2.
In this
case, we can only use a T-conorm based operator.

Typical T-norm operators are the minimum operator, the
product operator and the Łukasiewicz T-norm (tnŁ for short)
(max(0, a + b − 1)). The duality relation respectively yields
the following T-conorm: the maximum operator, the proba-
bilistic sum (ctps for short) (a + b − ab), and the bounded sum
(ctbs for short) (min(1, a + b)).

Although some criteria to choose between merging opera-
tors have been given in [Benferhat et al., 1997; 2002], these
criteria are not enough.

Suppose two PKBs B1 and B2 are consistent, then the de-
gree of conﬂict between them must be 0 and at least one of the
degrees of agreement is greater than 0. If the degree of strong
agreement between B1 and B2 is very high, then B1 and B2
share beliefs on most of the topics. In this case, it is advisable
to combine them using an operator with higher reinforcement
effect, for example, the Łukasiewicz t-norm max(0,a+b-1).
However, if the degree of strong agreement between B1 and
B2 is low and the degree of weak agreement between them is
very high, it is advisable to combine them using the minimum
operator which does not have any reinforcement effect.

Suppose B1 and B2 are in conﬂict, we usually use a T-
conorm to combine them. When the degree of conﬂict be-
tween B1 and B2 is very high, then B1 and B2 have mostly
different beliefs and we can choose the “bounded sum” oper-
ator which has a high counteract effect. On the other hand,
if the degree of conﬂict between B1 and B2 is very low, we
can choose the maximum which does not have any counteract
effect.

More formally, we have the following criteria to choose

between merging operators.
Merging operators selection criterion: Let ⊕1 and ⊕2 be
two operators applied to merge A and B, and C and D re-
spectively, then for all a, b∈[0, 1],
(1) ⊕1(a, b)≤ ⊕2 (a, b) if 0 < DCon(A, B) < DCon(C, D)
(2) ⊕1(a, b)≥ ⊕2 (a, b) if DCon(A, B) = 0 and
DSA(A, B) < DSA(C, D).

The merging
uct operator, and the result of merging is B =
{(p, 0.6), (q∨¬r, 0.7), (s, 0.6), (p, 0.5), (q, 0.4), (s, 0.4), (p,
0.8), (p∨q, 0.76), (p∨s, 0.76), (p∨q∨¬r, 0.85), (q∨¬r, 0.88),
(q∨¬r∨s, 0.88), (p∨s, 0.8), (q∨s, 0.76), (s, 0.76)}. How-
ever, if we use a Lukasiewicz t-norm, the result of merging
is B0 = {{(p, 0.6), (q∨¬r, 0.7), (s, 0.6), (p, 0.5), (q, 0.4),
(s, 0.4), (p, 1), (p∨q, 1), (p∨s, 1), (p∨q∨¬r, 1), (q∨¬r, 1),
(q∨¬r∨s, 1), (p∨s, 1), (q∨s, 1), (s, 1)}}. In B0, the weights
of formulae p and s are reinforced to 1. However,
the
certainty degrees of p and s are not high in both B1 and B2.
Moreover, B1 and B2 are not in strong agreement with each
other because DSA(B1, B2) = 0.43. So it is not reasonable
to increase the weights of p and s to the highest certainty
degree 1. In contrast, in B, p and s have certainty degrees
of 0.8 and 0.76 respectively. Therefore the result of the
product operator reﬂects the reinforcement of B1 and B2
more accurately than that of the Lukasiewicz t-norm.

4.2 Ordering sources
In this section, we deﬁne an ordering relation to compare dif-
ferent knowledge bases based on the degree of conﬂict.
Deﬁnition 18 Let Bi, Bj, B be three PKBs. A closeness re-
lation ¹B with regard to B is deﬁned as.

Bi¹BBj if f DCon(Bj, B)≤DCon(Bi, B)

Bj is closer to B than Bi to B (Bi¹BBj) iff Bj has less
quantity of conﬂict and more quantities of agreement with B
than Bi. If Bi¹BBj, then we may view Bj is less problem-
atic or more reliable than Bi with regard to B.
Example 10 Let B1 = {(¬p, 0.8), (¬q, 0.5), (¬r ∨ s, 0.7)},
B2 = {(¬p, 0.8), (¬q, 0.5), (¬r, 1), (s, 0.7)}, and B =
{(p∨q, 0.8), (¬s ∨ r, 1)}. Since DCon(B1, B) = 0.22 <
0.41 = DCon(B2, B), so B2¹BB1.

5 Conclusion
The main contribution of this work is that we not only mea-
sure the conﬂict between two prioritized knowledge bases but
also measure their agreement in two ways. We deﬁned the
quantity of conﬂict and two quantities of agreement. The
quantity of conﬂict is a generalization of the Dalal distance.
We then deﬁned the degree of conﬂict and degrees of agree-
ment based on both the quantity of conﬂict and the quantities
of agreement. We have shown that the deﬁnition of degree
of conﬂict is more reasonable than that deﬁned in [Hunter,
2004]. The measures of conﬂict and agreement can be very
useful in many applications, such as belief merging, argumen-
tation and heterogeneous source integration and management.
Another potential application of the measures of conﬂict is to
belief revision as we have shown that the quantity of conﬂict
generalizes the Dalal distance.

We didn’t touch the computational issue in this paper. It
is clear that the computations of measures of conﬂict and
agreement deﬁned in Section 3.2 and 3.3 depend on the com-
putation of WPIs. It has been shown in [Bittencourt et al.,

2004] that the computation of the set of prime implicants of
a formula represented by conjunctive normal form is N P -
complete using a transformation algorithm in [Bittencourt et
al., 2003]. Given a PKB B = {(φ1, a1), ..., (φn, an)} where
φi are clauses, it is expected that the computation of all the
WPIs of B is also N P -complete by generalizing the transfor-
mation algorithm. This problem will be discussed in a future
paper.
