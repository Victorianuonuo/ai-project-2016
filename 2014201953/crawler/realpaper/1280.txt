The  Delphi  Methodology.  We  found  that  the  Delphi 
methodology  has  the  following  advantages  and  disadvan­
tages. 

The  problem  of  participation.  There  are  two  basic 
problems  involved  in  the  solicitation  of  responses  on  a 
voluntary,  nonpayment  basis: 
(1)  approximately  five 
hours  of  expert  time  is  required  to  supply  answers  for 
a ll  three  rounds  of  the  Delphi,  and  most  experts  do  not 
have  much  time  to  spare  for  such  extra-curricular  stud­
ies,  (2) 
agrees  with  parts  or  a ll  of  the  Delphi  structure  or 
orientation,  but  does  not  feel  that  the  effort  required 
to  revise  the  questionnaire  is  worthwhile.  Such  an 
expert  may  respond  to  the  questionnaire,  but  in  a  half-
hearted  manner. 

there  is  the  problem  of  the  expert  who  dis­

The  problem  of  evaluating  expertise.  A  basic  prob­

lem  that  arises  in  a  Delphi  study  is  the  individual's 
rating  of  his  expertise.  Because  the  true  expert  may 
rate  himself  modestly,  while  the  novice  inflates  his 
capabilities,  we  find  a  tendency  for  the  responses  to 
cluster  in  the  "moderately  expert"  range.  We  thus  lose 
the  greater  importance  of  the  true  expert,  while  infla-
ting  the  importance  of  the  novice's  response.  Although 
there  does  not  seem  to  be  any  valid  way  to  overcome  this 
d i f f i c u l t y,  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  'calibrate'  the 
responses  using  a  technique  developed  by  Lipinski  [An­
drew  Lipinski,

Delphi  as  a  communications  tool.  As  has  been  i n­

dicated  by  Turoff  (1971),  Delphi  can  be  considered  as  a 
process  which  allows  the  establishment  of  a  meaningful 
group-communication  structure.  The  questionnaire  then 
serves  as  an  entree  to  the  expert,  and  enables  response 
to  be  obtained  that  would  ordinarily  not  be  available. 
We  found  that  communication  is  maximized  if  a  personal 
interview  is  available  after  the  expert  has  finished  a 
round  of  the  questionnaire,  because  comments  and  analy­
ses  which  would  not  appear  in  written  form  could  be 
captured  by  the  study  team. 

Delphi  as  an  organizing  tool.  We  found  the  cate­

gorization  and  organization  required  to  derive  the 
questionnaire  a  very  useful  exercise  in  helping  to 
analyze  the  f i e ld  of  a r t i f i c i al  intelligence.  Because 
we  are  forced  to  derive  a  meaningful  product  l i s t,  we 
had  to  examine  carefully  the  Al  capabilities,  postulate 

119 

products,  and  iterate  the  capabilities-product  process 
until  a  satisfactory  l i st  was  obtained.  After  the 
questionnaire  was  prepared  in  draft  form,  it  was  tried 
on  A.I  experts  at  SRI,  and  on  Delphi  experts  at  the 
Institute  for  the  Future,  Menlo  Park,  California,  and 
Pacific  House  Associates,  Palo  Alto,  California.  Their 
suggestions  lead  to  several  modifications  in  the  ques­
tionnaire  and  the  proposed  product  l i s t.  Thus  we  found 
the  preparation  of  the  Delphi  study  a  unique  organiza­
tional  tool,  one  which  forced  us  to  confront  the  basic 
problem  areas  in  AI  in  a  more  efficient  manner.
