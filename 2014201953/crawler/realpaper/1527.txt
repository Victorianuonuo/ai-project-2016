the  system  constructs  a  template  even  though  it 
contains  a  violated  preference,  and  ask  what 
should  an  i n t e l l i g e nt  system  infer  in  such  a 
s i t u a t i o n ?* 
to  drink  in  v i r t ue  of  something  a  system  might 
already  know  about  them,  namely  that  they  have  a 
f l u id  (gas/petrol) 
use  that  in  order  to  run.  That  is  to  say, 
program  should  have  access  to  a  s u f f i c i e n t ly  r ic  h 
k  nowledge  structure  to  express  the  fact  that  cars 
stand  in  a  r e l a t i on  to  a  p a r t i c u l ar  f l u i d,  a  r e l­
ation  that  i s,  of  the  "same  semantic  structure"  as 
the  r e l a t i on  in  which  a  drinker  normally  stands  to 
the  thing  drunk.  A ll  that  may  sound  obvious,  but 
how  else  are  we  to  account  for  the  naturalness  of 
( 3 ),  but  the  r e l a t i ve  unnaturalness  (and  uninter-
p r e t a b i l i t y)  of  "My  car  chews  gasoline",  and,  the 
more  d i s t a n t,  "My  car  carves  the  Sunday  roast". 
One  upshot  of  these  proposals  is  to  distinguish 
plausible  (with  respect  to  a  knowledge  base) 
preference  v i o l a t i on  from  the  implausible.** 

The  procedural  upshot  of  the  above  would  be 

to  replace  at  least  one  formula  in  the  template 
for  (3)  with  another,  either  constructed  by 
r u l e * **  or  drawn  from  the  knowledge  structure 
i t s e l f,  to  be  called  a  pseudo-text  (PT).  Let  us 
now  postulate  that  "car"  points  not  only  to  ( 6 ),

is  beyond  t h i s,  or  I  suspect  any,  general

rules  operating  on  the 

This  structure  is  called  a  pseudo-text 

because  it  is  of  j u st  the  same  format  as  the  text 
representations  produced  by  the  present NLUS.lt 
can  be  extended  to  taste  to  express  as  much 
specific  information  about  cars  as  is  thought 
appropriate.  Given  the  parser  for  the  present 
NLUS, 
it  could  even  be  input  as  real  text  about 
cars.  The  representation  consists  of  the  templates 
(explained  loosely  at  the  r i g h t ), 
the  self-explanatory)  case  and  cause  ties  between 
them. 
In  the  templates,;  denotes  a  dummy  and  * 
denotes  the  formula

items,  though  the  "IC  engine"  is  simply  a  specific-
dictionary  word  pointing  to  i ts  own  formula  -  -
s p e c i f i c i ty  is  thus  a  matter  of  taste.  So,  for 
example,  the  thesaurus  head  #*  l i q u id  could  be 
replaced  by  more  e x p l i c it  "gasoline".

together  with 

[car] 

It  w i ll  be  clear  that  the  same  information 

can  be  expresses  in  a  number  of  d i f f e r e nt  ways, 
and  at  d i f f e r e nt  levels  of  generality; 
though 
the  s p i r it  of  (Minsky  1975)  suggests  that  they 
should  be  as  specific  as  possible.  The  intention 
here  is  that  THE  PROCESSES  THAT  OPERATE  ON  SUCH 
ENTITIES  AS(7)  SHALL  BE  IDENTICAL  WITH  THOSE  THAT 
OPERATE  ON  SUCH  ENTITIES  AS  (7)  SHALL  BE  IDENTICAL 
WITH  THOSE  THAT  MANIPULATE  REPRESENTATIONS  DERIVED 
FROM  INPUT  TEXTS.  The  approach  is  thus  the 
reverse  of  the  conventional  one:  we  seek  to  ass­
imilate  knowledge  structures  to  text  structures, 
rather  than  the  reverse,  on  the  grounds  that  the 
representation  of  language  is 
the  d i f f i c u lt  task, 
and  that  the  representation  of  knowledge  as  such 
makes  no  sense  apart  from  t h a t. 

We  should  note  too,  that  j u st  as  the  thesaurus 

structure  imposes  a  containment  r e l a t i on  on  the 
formulas  of  co-row-member  words,  so  it  also  imposes 
a  hierarchical  relationship  on  PTs:  that  for 
# vehicle, 
for  example,  w i ll  be  a  less  specific 
version  of  ( 7 ).  Further  up  the  thesaurus  would 
be  PTs  for  high-level  sections:  that  for  the
