This  p o s s i b i l i ty  draws  upon  tha  psycho(cid:173)
logy  of  tha  subjective  a t t r i b u t i on  of  causes  to 
stimulus  events.  Application  to  the  design  of 
conversational  programs  ia 
praaant  work  concerns  application  to  the  aimulation 
of  a  b e l i ef  system.  Simple  sentences  known  by  the 
system  ara  grouped  i n to  categorical  types.  An 
" i m p l i c a t i o n al  molecule"  ia  a  meaningful  aet  of 
sentence  types  w i th  l i n k ed  elements, 
f or  example: 
A  doea  X,  X  causes  Y,  A  wants  Y.  One  important 
way  in  which  meaning  can  ba  ascribed  to  an  input 
sentence 
f or  a  molecule 
which  ia  then  " f i l l e d"  by  other  information  in 
tha  system.

respond,  "How  d id  you  go  to  three  drugstores?"  A 
semantically  based  program  might  respond,  "What

But  a  pragmatically  based  program  ought  to  be  c l e(cid:173)

Even  such  a  simple  example  is  p i t t ed  with 

problems,  and  one  ahould  note  that  the  inference 
that  at  least  two  drugstores  d i d n 't  have  what 
the  person  wanted  might  be  i n c o r r e c t.  No  pragmatic 
program  can  be  correct  a ll  the  t i m e,  and  it  seems 
quite  u n l i k e ly  that  a  good  program  would  turn  out 
to  make  more  i n t e l l i g e nt  a t t r i b u t i o ns  than  people
