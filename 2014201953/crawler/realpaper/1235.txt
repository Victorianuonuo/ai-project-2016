Introduction 

Imagine  an  e x t r a t e r r e s t r i al  e n t i ty  sent  to 
earth  to  c o l l e ct  information  from  human  beings. 
It  has  no  senses,  as  we  know  them,  and  it  cannot 
move  about.

it  has  p a r t i c i p a t ed  in  dialogues  w i th  a  number  of 
humans,  what  would

We  have  realized  t h is  imagined  situation  by 

in 

creating  an  a r t i f i c i al  b e l i ef  system  (ABS}) 
the  form  of  a  computer  program.  Our  goal  was  to 
study  c e r t a in  properties  of  c r e d i b i l i ty 
functions 
in  a  synthesized  a r t i f i c i al  system  whose  structure 
and  s t a r t i ng  conditions  were  e n t i r e ly  under  our 
c o n t r o l.  Before  describing  the  a r t i f a ct  and  i ts 
behavior,  perhaps  something  should  be  sa i.d  abuut 
the  research  strategy  involved  and  i ts  relevance 
to  a r t i f i c i al 

i n t e l l i g e n c e. 

One  synthesizes  an  imaginary  system  to  .".  simplity 

a  computer  problem  and  to  bring  v a r i a b i l i ty  under 
c o n t r o l. 
In  the  case  of  c r e d i b i l i ty  processes 
in 
humans  we  are  dealing  w i th  complex  i n t e l l i g e nt 
behavior  d i f f i c u lt 
to  control  and  manipulate. 
Hence,  one  would  l i ke  to  work  w i th  a  simpler 
system  showing  some  of  the  essential  properties 
of  a  human  b e l i ef  system. 

Given  that  one  creates  such  a  system  to 

achieve  exactness,  s i m p l i c i ty  and  conciseness, 
how  is  the  a r t i f a ct  to  be  manipulated  or  set 
in 
conceptual  motion?  A r t i f i c i al  intelligence  pro(cid:173)
vides  a  way  of  reversing  the  t r a d i t i o n al  technique 
of  experimentation  w i th  humans. 
Instead  of  placing 
a  person  under  the  a r t i f i c i al  conditions  of  a 
laboratory  experiment,  we  can  subject  an  a r t i f j e i al 
system  to  the  naturally-occurring  conditions  of 
human  l i n g u i s t ic  communication.  Our  purpose  is  to 
in 
study  the  processes  of  c r e d i b i l i ty  functions 
a  synthesized  a r t i f a ct  designed  to  perform  the 
i n t e l l i g e nt  task  of  a r r i v i ng  at  states  of  b e l i ef

is  a  computer  program,  w r i t t en  in  MLISP, 
which  runs  in  an  i n t e r a c t i ve  mode  on  the  PDP-6/lO

The  program  instructions  of  ABS1  consist  of 

input  strings  and

he  wishes  using  any  vocabulary  names  he  chooses.
