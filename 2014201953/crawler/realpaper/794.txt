Abstract

Current research on qualitative spatial representa-
tion and reasoning usually focuses on one single as-
pect of space. However, in real world applications,
several aspects are often involved together. This pa-
per extends the well-known RCC8 constraint lan-
guage to deal with both topological and directional
information, and then investigates the interaction
between the two kinds of information. Given a
topological (RCC8) constraint network and a di-
rectional constraint network, we ask when the joint
network is satisﬁable. We show that when the topo-
logical network is over one of the three maximal
tractable subclasses of RCC8, the problem can be
reduced into satisﬁability problems in the RCC8 al-
gebra and the rectangle algebra (RA). Therefore,
reasoning techniques developed for RCC8 and RA
can be used to solve the satisﬁability problem of a
joint network.

1 Introduction

Originating from Allen’s work on temporal interval algebra
(IA) [Allen, 1983], the qualitative approach to temporal as
well as spatial information is popular in Artiﬁcial Intelligence
and related research ﬁelds. This is mainly because in many
applications precise numerical information is usually unavail-
able or not necessary.

While Allen’s interval algebra is the principal formalism of
qualitative temporal reasoning, there are more than a dozen of
formalisms that deal with different aspects of space in qual-
itative spatial reasoning (QSR). Spatial relations are usually
classiﬁed as topological, directional, and metric. Metric re-
lations have a nature of semi-quantitative and fuzziness. In
this paper, we are concerned with topological and directional
relations between plane regions.

Most earlier research on topological and directional rela-
tions focuses on one single aspect. The most inﬂuential for-
malism for topological relations is the Region Connection

Calculus (RCC) [Randell et al., 1992]. As for directional re-
lations, there are several well-known formalisms, e.g. [Frank,
1991; Goyal and Egenhofer, 2001].

In natural language and many practical applications, topo-
logical and directional relations are used together. For exam-
ple, when describing the location of Titisee, a famous tourist
sight in Germany, we might say “Titisee is in the Black Forest
and is east of the town of Freiburg.”

In this paper we extend the RCC8 constraint language to
deal with topological as well as directional information. We
ﬁrst formalize the four cardinal directional relations between
plane regions, viz. west, east, north, south, and then deﬁne
nine basic relations by using the usual relational operations
of intersection and complementation.

An important reasoning problems is to decide when a net-
work of topological and directional constraints is satisﬁable
(or consistent). Given a network of topological (RCC8) con-
straints Θ and a network of directional constraints Δ, we try
to decide when the joint network Θ (cid:3) Δ is satisﬁable.

Since topological and directional information is not inde-
pendent, Θ (cid:3) Δ may be unsatisﬁable despite that both Θ and
Δ are satisﬁable. Our main result states that, if topological
constraints are all in one of the three maximal tractable sub-
classes of RCC8 [Renz, 1999], then the satisﬁability of the
joint network can be determined by considering the satisﬁa-
bility of two related networks in, resp., RCC8 and the rectan-
gle algebra (RA), where RA is the two-dimensional counter-
part of IA [Balbiani et al., 1999].

The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 intro-
duces basic notions and well-known examples of qualitative
calculi. The cardinal direction calculus DIR9 is introduced in
Section 3. Section 4 describes and proves the main result. A
new subclass, Amax, of IA is identiﬁed, which is closed under
converse, intersection, and composition. We show satisﬁable
interval networks over Amax has a maximal instantiation in
the sense of [Ligozat, 1994]. Section 5 concludes the paper.

fessorship.

The establishment of a proper qualitative calculus is the key
to the success of the qualitative approach to temporal and spa-
tial reasoning. This section introduces basic notions and ex-
amples of qualitative calculi (cf. [Ligozat and Renz, 2004]).

2.1 Basic notions
Let U be the universe of temporal/spatial/spatial-temporal en-
tities, and set Rel(U) to be the set of binary relations on U.
With the usual relational operations of intersection, union,
and complement, Rel(U) is a Boolean algebra.

A ﬁnite set B of nonempty relations on U is jointly exhaus-
tive and pairwise disjoint (JEPD for short) if any two entities
in U are related by one and only one relations in B. Write
(cid:4)B(cid:5) for the subalgebra of Rel(U) generated by B. Clearly,
relations in B are atoms in the algebra (cid:4)B(cid:5). We call (cid:4)B(cid:5) a
qualitative calculus on U, and call relations in B basic rela-
tions of the calculus.

There are several general (but optional) restrictions on the
choice of B. Write idU for the identity relation on U. For a
relation α ∈ Rel(U), write α∼ for the converse of α, which
is deﬁned as (x, y) ∈ α∼ iff (y, x) ∈ α. Many qualitative
calculi require the identity relation idU to be a basic relation.
In this paper, we relax this restriction, and require that (i) idU
is contained in one basic relation; and (ii) B is closed under
converse, i.e. if α is a basic relation, then so is α∼.

Note that the composition of two relations in (cid:4)B(cid:5) is not
necessarily in (cid:4)B(cid:5). For α, β ∈ (cid:4)B(cid:5), the weak composition
[Ligozat and Renz, 2004] of α and β, written as α ◦w β, is
deﬁned to be the smallest relation in (cid:4)B(cid:5) which contains α◦β.
An important reasoning problem in a qualitative calculus
is to determine the satisﬁability or consistency of a network
Γ of constraints of the form xγy, where γ is a relation in (cid:4)B(cid:5).
A constraint network Γ = {viγij vj}n
i,j=1 is satisﬁable (or
consistent) if there is an instantiation {ai}n
i=1 in U such that
(ai, aj) ∈ γij holds for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n.

Consistency of a network can be approximated by using
an O(n3) time path-consistency algorithm (PCA). A network
i,j=1 is path-consistent if (i) γii is the basic
Γ = {viγijvj }n
relation in B that contains idU; (ii) ∅ (cid:9)= γij = γji
∼; and (iii)
γij ⊆ γik ◦w γkj for all i, j, k.

The essence of a PCA is to apply the following rules for

any three i, j, k until the network is stable.

γij ← γij ∩ γji
γij ← γij ∩ γik ◦w γkj

If the empty relation occurs during the process, then the net-
work is inconsistent, otherwise the resulting network is path-
consistent.

Interval algebra and rectangle algebra

2.2
The interval algebra IA [Allen, 1983] is generated by a set
Bint of 13 basic relations between time intervals (see Ta-
ble 1). IA is closed under composition, i.e. the composition of
any two interval relations is in IA. Nebel and B¨urckert [Nebel
and B¨urckert, 1995] identiﬁed a maximal tractable subclass
H of IA, called ORD-Horn subclass, and showed that apply-
ing PCA is sufﬁcient for deciding satisﬁability for H.

Ligozat [Ligozat, 1994] introduced a partial order (cid:13) on
Bint (see Fig. 1), and termed (Bint, (cid:13)) the interval lattice.
For α, β ∈ Bint, we write [α, β] for the union of relations
between α and β. Note that [α, β] is nonempty iff α (cid:13) β. For
example, [o, oi] is the relation ∪{o, s, f, d, eq, di, ﬁ, si, oi}.
An interval relation is called convex if it is of the form [α, β]

with α, β ∈ Bint. For α ∈ Bint, dim(α), the dimension of
α, is deﬁned [Ligozat, 1994] (see Table 1). The dimension
of a non-basic relation is the maximal dimension of its basic
relations.

The following convex relations are of particular impor-

tance in this paper:

(cid:2) = ∪{m, o, s, f, d, eq, di, ﬁ, si, oi, mi}
(cid:3) = ∪{s, d, eq, f}
(cid:4) = ∪{ﬁ, di, eq, si}

(5)

The rectangle algebra (RA) is the two-dimensional coun-
terpart of IA. RA is generated by a set of 169 JEPD relations
between rectangles.1 Write Brec for this set, i.e.

Brec = {α ⊗ β : α, β ∈ Bint}

(6)

For a rectangle r, write Ix(r) and Iy(r) as, resp., the x-
and y-projection of r. The basic rectangle relation between
two rectangles a, b is α ⊗ β iff (Ix(a), Ix(b)) ∈ α and
(Iy(a), Iy(b)) ∈ β. The dimension of a basic rectangle re-
lation α ⊗ β is deﬁned as dim(α ⊗ β) = dim(α) + dim(β).
The dimension of a non-basic rectangle relation is deﬁned to
be the maximal dimension of its basic relations.

Note that if S is a tractable subclass of IA, then S ⊗ S =
{α ⊗ β : α, β ∈ S} is also tractable in RA. A tractable sub-
class of RA larger than H ⊗ H is also obtained in [Balbiani
et al., 1999], where H is the ORD-Horn subclass of IA.

1In this paper we always assume that the two sides of a rectangle
are parallel to the axes of some predeﬁned orthogonal basis in the
Euclidean plane.

2.3 RCC8 algebra

A plane region (or region) is a nonempty regular closed sub-
set of the real plane. The relations in Table 2 and the con-
verses of TPP and NTPP form a JEPD set [Randell et al.,
1992]. These are RCC8 basic relations. Write Btop for this
set. The RCC8 algebra is (cid:4)Btop(cid:5). We write P and PP, resp.,
for TPP ∪ NTPP ∪ EQ and TPP ∪ NTPP.

Renz [Renz, 1999] showed that there are only three maxi-
mal tractable subclasses of RCC8 that contain all basic rela-
tions. These subclasses are denoted as
subclasses, applying PCA is sufﬁcient for deciding the sat-
isﬁability of a network, and there is an O(n2) algorithm for
ﬁnding an atomic reﬁnement of any path-consistent network.

3 The Cardinal Direction Calculus DIR9
For a bounded plane region a, deﬁne supx(a) = sup{x ∈
R : (∃y)(x, y) ∈ a}, inf x(a) = inf{x ∈ R : (∃y)(x, y) ∈
a}. The deﬁnitions of inf y(a) and supy(a) are similar. We
call M(a) = Ix(a) × Iy(a) the minimum bounding rectangle
(MBR) of a, where Ix(a) = [inf x(a), supx(a)] and Iy(a) =
[inf y(a), supy(a)] are the x- and y-projection of a.

For two bounded plane regions a, b, if supx(a) < inf x(b),
then we say a is west of b and b is east of a, written as aWb
and bEa; and if supy(a) < inf y(b) then we say a is south of
b and b is north of a, written as aSb and bNa.

When a is neither west nor east of b, then Ix(a) ∩ Ix(b) (cid:9)=
∅. In this case, we say a is in x-contact with b, written as
aCxb. Similarly, if a is neither north nor south of b, then we
say a is in y-contact with b, written as aCyb.

The Boolean algebra generated by N,S,W,E, written as
DIR9, has nine atoms (see Table 3). Although it is very sim-
ple, DIR9 is sufﬁcient for expressing directional information
in many situations. Moreover, DIR9 is a subclass of RA.
Remark 3.1. Let B3
int be the JEPD set {p, (cid:2), pi}. The algebra
(cid:4)B3
int(cid:5) is in fact the interval algebra A3 studied in [Golumbic
and Shamir, 1993]. Let H3 = {p, (cid:2), pi, p ∪ (cid:2), (cid:2) ∪ pi, (cid:20)},
where (cid:20) is the universal relation. Note that H3 = A3 ∩ H.
Golumbic and Shamir proved that H3 is a maximal tractable
subclass of A3. Since A3 ⊗ A3 is exactly DIR9 (see Table 3),
H3 ⊗H3 is a tractable subclass of DIR9.2 It will be our future
work to ﬁnd maximal tractable subclasses of DIR9.

2It is worth noting that the intersection of DIR9 and N is H3 ⊗
H3, where N is the new tractable subset of RA of [Balbiani et al.,
1999].

4 Main result
Suppose V = {vi}n
i=1 is a collection of spatial variables,
Θ = {θij}n
i=1 are, resp., a topological
(RCC8) and a directional (DIR9) constraint network over V .
Our problem is when the joint network Θ (cid:3) Δ is satisﬁable.
Without loss of generality, in this section we assume (i)
ji for all i (cid:9)= j;

θii = EQ for all i and EQ (cid:9)= θij = θ∼
and (ii) δii = CC and δij = δ∼

ji for all i, j.

The following example shows that topological and direc-

tional constraints are not independent.
Example 4.1. Let V = {v1, v2}, θ12 = EC, δ12 = NC.
Both Θ and Δ are trivially satisﬁable. For any two regions
a, b, if aECb, then by a∩b (cid:9)= ∅ we know M(a)∩M(b) (cid:9)= ∅,
hence aNCb cannot hold. Therefore Θ (cid:3) Δ is inconsistent.

Given Θ and Δ, we deﬁne an RCC8 network Θ and an RA

network Δ as follows:

if θij = EQ;
if EQ (cid:9)= θij ⊆ P;
if EQ (cid:9)= θij ⊆ P∼;

otherwise.

Note that θij ⊆ θij and δij ⊆ δij for any two i, j. This means
Θ is a reﬁnement of Θ and Δ is a reﬁnement of Δ (in RA).
Lemma 4.1. Θ (cid:3) Δ is satisﬁable iff Θ (cid:3) Δ is satisﬁable.

As for Example 4.1, by δ12 = NC we know θ12 = EC ∩

DC = ∅. Therefore the joint network is inconsistent.

The main contribution of this paper is to show that if Θ is a
path-consistent RCC8 network over one of the three maximal
tractable subclasses of RCC8, viz.
satisﬁable iff Θ and Δ are satisﬁable.

To prove this result, we need two further lemmas.
For r = [x−, x+] × [y−, y+] and  > 0, we write r + 
for [x− − /2, x+ + /2] × [y− − /2, y+ + /2]. For two
rectangles r1, r2, if no edges of r1 are in line with any edge
of r2, then we can expand the two rectangles a little without
changing their rectangle relation. In general, we have

i=1 is a
collection of bounded plane regions such that ri ⊂ M(ai) ⊂

• If θij (cid:9)= DC, then ri ∩ rj is a rectangle, i.e. the interior

of ri ∩ rj is nonempty;

• If θij ⊆ PP, then ri is contained in the interior of rj .

Lemma 4.3. Let Θ = {viθij vj}n
i,j=1 be a satisﬁable RCC8
basic network. Suppose {ri}n
i=1 is a collection of rectan-

as deﬁned in Lemma 4.2.

Proof. The proof is similar to that given for RCC8 (cf. [Renz,
1998; Li, 2006b; Li and Wang, 2006]). First, we deﬁne l(i),
the ntpp-level of vi, inductively as follows:

• l(i) = 1 if there is no j such that θji = NTPP;
• l(i) = k + 1 if there is a variable vj such that (a) l(j) =
k and θji = NTPP, and (b) θmi = NTPP implies
l(m) ≤ k for any variable vm.

Write Eik (k = 1, · · · , 4) for the four corner points of ri.
For i (cid:9)= j, if θij is EC or PO, then choose two new points
Pij and Pji in the interior of ri ∩ rj. Set N to be the set
of these points, and set δ to be the smallest distance between
two points in N . Clearly 0 < δ < . For each point P in N ,
construct a system of squares {p−, p+, p(1), · · · , p(n)} as in
Fig. 2, where p(n)
is a square centered at P with the length of
δ/2, and p− and p+
are two smaller squares that meet at P .

4.1 Maximal instantiation of rectangle networks
For an RCC8 network Θ and a DIR9 network Δ, suppose Θ
and Δ are satisﬁable, and Θ∗ is the atomic reﬁnement of Θ
constructed in the proof of Theorem 4.1. We show Δ has a
rectangle realization {ri}n

i=1 that is compatible with Θ∗.

We ﬁrst deﬁne an auxiliary subclass Amax of IA.
Deﬁnition 4.2. An interval relation α is in Amax if

• α is convex;
• m ⊆ α only if o ⊆ α, and mi ⊆ α only if oi ⊆ α;
• s ⊆ α only if d ⊆ α, and si ⊆ α only if di ⊆ α;
• f ⊆ α only if d ⊆ α, and ﬁ ⊆ α only if di ⊆ α.
Note that all Amax relations except eq are of dimension 2.
By the deﬁnition of Amax, it is easy to see that Amax is
closed under converse and intersection. The following lemma
further asserts that Amax is closed under composition.
Lemma 4.4. If α, β ∈ Amax, then α ◦ β ∈ Amax.

Proof. (Sketch.) Since the composition of two convex rela-
tions is still convex, α ◦ β is convex too.

If m ⊆ α ◦ β, then there exist two basic relations a, b such
that a ⊆ α, b ⊆ β, and m ⊆ a ◦ b. By checking the com-
position table of IA [Allen, 1983], we have o (cid:9)⊆ a ◦ b iff (i)
a = m and b ∈ {s, eq, si}; or (ii) a ∈ {f, eq, ﬁ} and b = m.
By a ⊆ α ∈ Amax and b ⊆ β ∈ Amax, we know o ⊆ α
or o ⊆ β. By the composition table we have o ⊆ o ◦ b or
o ⊆ a ◦ o, hence o ⊆ α ◦ β. This means m ⊆ α ◦ β only
if o ⊆ α ◦ β. Symmetrically, we can show mi ⊆ α ◦ β only
if oi ⊆ α ◦ β. The proofs for the remaining four cases are
similar. In this way we know α ◦ β is also in Amax.

We next characterize when a composition of two relations

in Amax can contain eq.
Lemma 4.5. For two interval relations α, β ∈ Amax, if eq ⊆
α ◦ β, then eq ⊆ α ∩ β or [o, oi] ⊆ α ◦ β.
Proof. By Lemma 4.4 we know α ◦ β is in Amax. If eq ∈
α◦β, then there exist two basic relations a, b such that a ⊆ α,
b ⊆ β, and eq ⊆ a ◦ b. This is possible iff b is the converse
of a. Suppose a (cid:9)= eq. There are two possible situations.
If a ∈ {p, o, d, di, oi, pi}, then by the composition table we
know [o, oi] ⊆ a ◦ b. If a ∈ {m, s, f, ﬁ, si, mi}, then a ◦ b is
f ∪ eq ∪ ﬁ or s ∪ eq ∪ si. Since α ◦ β ∈ Amax, we know
d, di are contained in α ◦ β. Checking Fig. 1, we know [o, oi]
is the smallest convex relation which contains both d and di.
Therefore [o, oi] is contained in the convex relation α◦ β.

The following lemma characterizes when an eq relation
can be obtained as the intersection of two relations in Amax.
Lemma 4.6. For two Amax relations α (cid:9)= eq and β (cid:9)= eq, if
α ∩ β = eq, then α = β∼ and α is either (cid:3) or (cid:4).
Proof. If α is neither (cid:3) nor (cid:4), then [o, oi] is contained in α.
Note that in this case, by α ∩ β = eq, we have β = eq. This
is a contradiction. So α is (cid:3) or (cid:4). The same conclusion also
holds for β. Clearly, α is the converse of β.

Lemma 4.7. For two Amax relations α (cid:9)= eq and β (cid:9)= eq, if
α ◦ β =(cid:3), then α = β =(cid:3); if α ◦ β =(cid:4), then α = β =(cid:4).

Proof. By Lemma 4.5 we know eq ⊆ α ∩ β. Since α is not
eq, either (cid:3) or (cid:4) is contained in α. The same conclusion
holds for β. By α ◦ β =(cid:3) and eq ⊆ α ∩ β, we know α and
β can only be (cid:3).

As a corollary of the above two lemmas, we have

Corollary 4.2. For three Amax relations α (cid:9)= eq, β (cid:9)= eq,
γ (cid:9)= eq, α ∩ β ◦ γ = eq iff α = β∼ = γ∼ and α is (cid:3) or (cid:4).
Since [o, oi] is the smallest convex relation in Amax which

strictly contains (cid:3), we have the following result.
Lemma 4.8. For α, β ∈ Amax, if α ∩ β =(cid:3), then either one
is (cid:3); if α ∩ β =(cid:4), then either one is (cid:4).

consistent, then there is a maximal instantiation of Λ.3

The path-consistency condition in the above theorem is
necessary. For example, if Λ is the constraint network {x (cid:3)
y (cid:3) z (cid:3) x}, then Λ is satisﬁable but has no maximal instan-
tiation: by applying PCA we obtain x eq y eq z eq x.

But when only relations in Amax are concerned, we have

the following result.

only relations in Amax. Suppose Λ is satisﬁable and for all
i, j, k we have (a) λij = eq iff i = j; (b) λij = λ∼

λik =(cid:3) ∧λkj =(cid:3)→ λij =(cid:3). Then Λ has a maximal instan-

Proof. Suppose by applying PCA the network will be stable
after m steps. We prove by induction that at no step this in-
troduces new (cid:3) or (cid:4) or eq constraints. This means that, for
each step 1 ≤ p ≤ m, λp
ij = λij ,
where λp
ij is the relation between xi and xj after the p-th step.
Suppose this holds for p ≥ 1. We show it holds for step

We will next show when a (cid:3) or (cid:4) relation can be generated

Now, since Λ is satisﬁable, applying PCA on Λ will obtain
a path-consistent network Λ∗, which is still over Amax and
satisﬁes the following condition: For any i (cid:9)= j, λ∗

It is easy to see that Δ(cid:4) is satisﬁable iff both Λx and Λy are

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have investigated the interaction between
topological and directional constraints. We have showed that,
for the three maximal tractable subclasses of RCC8, the prob-
lem of deciding the satisﬁability of a joint network of topolog-
ical and directional constraints can be reduced to two simple
satisﬁability problems in RCC8 and RA.

An earlier attempt to combining topological and directional
information was reported in [Li, 2006a], where we introduced
a hybrid calculus that combines DIR9 with RCC5. A prelim-
inary result was obtained, which states that the consistency
of atomic networks in the hybrid calculus can be decided in
polynomial time.

Sistla and Yu [Sistla and Yu, 2000] considered a similar
problem of reasoning about spatial relations in picture re-
trieval systems, where mereological relations inside, outside,
overlaps, and directional relations left, above, behind are con-
sidered. The constraint language considered there is rather re-
strictive. It can express neither genuine topological relations
(e.g. tangential proper part and externally connected to) nor
negations of some relations (e.g. neither left nor right).
