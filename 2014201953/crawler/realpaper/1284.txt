Abstract 

Abduction  Is  a  basic  form  of  l o g i c al  inference, 

which  is  said  to  engender  the  use  of  plans,  percep(cid:173)
tual  models,  i n t u i t i o n s,  and  analogical  reasoning  -
a ll  aspects  of  I n t e l l i g e nt  behavior  that  have  so  far 
f a i l ed  to  f i nd  representation  in  existing  formal  de(cid:173)
ductive  systems.  This  paper  explores  the  abductive 
reasoning  process  and  develops  a  model  for  i ts  mech(cid:173)
anization, .which  consists  of  an  embedding  of  deduc(cid:173)
t i ve  logic  in  an  i t e r a t i ve  hypothesis  and  test  pro(cid:173)
cedure.  An  application  of  the  method  to  the  problem 
of  medical  diagnosis  is  discussed.

1.1  The  Information  Structure 

A  deduction  problem  is  t y p i c a l ly  stated  in  terms

of  a  c o l l e c t i on  of  axioms  A  and  a  conjecture  C 
which  is  to  be  deduced  from  the  axioms.

negation  of  C  to  the  set  A,  convert  the  resulting  set 
of  expressions  to  quantifier  free  form, 
then  to  search 
for  evidence  of  a  contradiction  that  would  render  the 
expression  AAC  unsatisfiable.  An  alternative  formu­
l a t i on  of  the  problem  would  be  to  search  for  direct 
proof  of  the  disjunction  AVC. 
In  t h is  section,  we 
discuss  the  procedure  from  yet  a  t h i rd  point  of  view  -
namely,  the  demonstration  of  At-C; 
taking  the

The  f i r st  step  in  our  procedure  is  to  convert  the 

axiom  set  A  to  conjunctive-normal  q u a n t i f i e r - f r ee  form, 
using  the  techniques  f i r st  outlined  by  Davis,-'-3  Or­
d i n a r i l y,  the  conjecture  C.  would  then  be  negated  and 
added  to  t h is  axiom  set. 
In  our  case,  however,  as  in 
the  direct  proof  procedures  of  Cooper14  and  Maslov15 
the  conjecture 
transformed  i n to  disjunctive  normal 
form  on  the  basis  of  the  following  revised  rules: 

is 

1.  elimination  of  implication; 

(as  described  by  Davis) 

2.  reduction  of  the  scope  of  negation; 

(as  in  Davis) 

3.  replacement  of  each  universally  quantified  variable 

by  a  skolem  function  having  as  arguments  the  v a r i­
ables  of  any  e x i s t e n t i al  quantifiers  occurring 
before  the  universal  q u a n t i f i e r. 

4.  elimination  of  e x i s t e n t i al  q u a n t i f i e r s. 

5.  transformation  of  the  r e s u l t i ng  expression  to 

disjunctive  normal 

form. 

The  result  of  t h is  process  w i ll  be  a  disjunctive  ex­
pression  consisting  of  one  or  more  conjunctive  sets 
of 

l i t e r a l s. 

These  forms  of  reasoning  a ll  e n t a il  the  same 

underlying  representation  of  information.  Whatever 
language  is  used  to  express  the  axioms  and  conjec­
tures  of  a  deductive  system  can  also  be  used  to  ex­
press  the  observations  and  hypotheses  required  for 
induction  or  abduction.  However,  although  they  em­
ploy  a  common  information  structure,  each  of  these 
inference  schemes  requires  the  development  of  a 
separate  computational  procedure 
t i o n. 

for  i ts  mechaniza­

Some  work  has  been  reported  in  the  l i t e r a t u re 

dealing  with  such  procedures;  these  have, 
most  part  dealt  with  approaches  to  the  mechanization 
of  induction,  •  although  there  has  also  been  report 
of  at  least  one  abductive  system  that  takes  a 
' B r i t i sh  Museum'  approach  to  the  generation  of  a ll 
possible  hypotheses.9 

for  the 

The  r e al  problem  in  t h is  area,  of  course, 

is  the 

that  hypothesis  which  is  the  simplest  -

selective  generation  of  hypotheses  that  have  some 
reasonable  prospect  of  being  v a l i d.  Our  approach  to 
t h is  problem  has  been  guided  by  our  i n t e r p r e t a t i on  of 
the  t r a d i t i o n al  maxim  of  Occam's  Razor,  which  requires

that  the  process  of  abductive  inference  can  be  ac­
complished  by  means  of  a  procedure  that  makes  use  of 
much  of  the  machinery  already  developed  for  deductive 
l o g i c.  Although  our  abduction  procedure  has  been 
implemented  using  GOL10  as  the  basic  deductive  pro­
cessor,  for  purposes  of  explication  we  describe  the 
procedure  in  the  context  of  the  better  known  deduction

1.  Linear  Resolution  Viewed  as  a  Problem  Reduction 

Procedure 

In  t h is  section,  we  provide  a  somewhat  unorthodox 

description  of  the  axioms,  conjectures,  and  i n t e r­
mediate  structures  that  arise  in  the  course  of  a 
t y p i c al  linear  deduction.  Our  purpose  is  to  show  that 
linear  resolution  can  usefully  be  viewed  as  a  problem-
reduction  procedure  (cf.  Nilsson 
),  which  uses  back­
ward  search  to  develop  direct  derivations  of  conjunc­
t i ve  sets  of  subgoals. 
It  is  a  r e l a t i v e ly  small  step 
then  to  show  how  the  same  sort  of  search,  operating 
on  the  same  form  of  data,  can  be  used  abductively  to 
develop  d i r e ct 
'explanations'  of  conjunctive  sets  of 
observations.

Interpretation  of  the  deduction  procedure 

The  sub-problems  described  in  the  preceding 

section  correspond  in  an  obvious  manner  to  the  various

from  our  interpretation  of  the  axioms  as  productions, 
is  essentially  the  same  as  the  S-linear  resolution 
method  described  by  Loveland11. 

A  linear  deduction  is  a  procedure  that 

'solves' 

the  conjunctive  problem  posed  by  a  conjecture  by 
systematically  dealing  with  each  of  the  conjuncts

If  a  successor  node  is  n u ll 

( i . e .,  contains  no 

further  sub-problems),

to  the  o r i g i n al  problem.  A  non-null  node  with  no 
successors  cannot  be  solved.

In  such  cases,  it 
can  be  shown  t h a t,  provided  that  a ll  other  conjunctive 
subgoals  in  the  tree  are  s a t i s f i e d,  a  proof  of  S  has 
been  established  by  reductio  ad  absurdura,  and  that  the 
contradictory  subgoal  can  be  deleted  from  further  con­
sideration,  immediately  upon  i ts  generation.  This 
refinement  to  the  basic  problem-reduction  scheme  can 
be  seen  to  be  related  to  the  subsumption  condition 
which  is  required

for  completeness  of  linear  resolution 

These  formulations  of  the  problem  are  surrogates 

to  solution  of  the  o r i g i n al  problem.

they  constitute  an  "OR"

d i t i on  (namely  M)  under  which  Li  can  be  deduced  (by 
means  of  Modus  Ponens  perhaps  with  s u b s t i t u t i o n ). 
Similar  implicative  expressions  can  be  developed  to 
assert  the  conditions  under  which  each  of  the  other

These  implicative  expressions  can  be  thought  of 

as  productions,  or  'rewrite  rules,  that  are  the 
transformations  by  which  a  problem  may  be  'reduced'  -
i . e .,  replaced  by  an  equivalent  set  of  sub-problems.

to  emphasize  the  conditional  nature  of  axioms  1  and  2,

formation  project  which  has  been  reported  previously, 
and  a  study  of  planning  in  organic  synthesis,  r e­
cently  completed  by  Smith,  19which  uses  abduction  to 
develop  strategies  for  deductive  planning  of  a  syn­
thesis.  Another  interesting  project,  now  nearing 
completion,  uses  abductive  logic  to  develop  per­
ceptual  models  for  use  in  natural  language  compre­
hension;  another  exploits  the  planning  and  model-
building  c a p a b i l i t i es  of  the  system  in  the  automatic 
programming  task  environment. 

There  would  appear  to  be  a  number  of  ways  to 

go  from  here.  As  practical  systems  of  higher  logic 
become  available,  we  may  want  to  raise  the  sights  of 
the  abduction  processor  accordingly;  our  GOL  imple­
mentation  already  has  limited 
'higher  l e v e l'  capa­
b i l i t i es  that  have  been  found  extremely  useful  in 
some  applications.  Certainly,  the  procedure  should 
be  extended  to  include  a  mechanization  of  induction 
as  well  as  the  other  two  forms  of  inference: 
reasoning  by  analogy,  according  to  Peirce,  consists 
of  an  induction  and  an  abduction  followed  by  a 
deduction.  Additional  applications  that  may  shed 
further  l i g ht  on  the  processes  involved,  such  as 
procedures  for  strategic  planning  in  theorem  proving, 
should  be  investigated. 

While  we  have  in  no  way  begun  to  exhaust  the 

questions  and  issues  that  t h is  new  methodology  raises, 
results  from  our  i n i t i al 
encouraged  us  to  continue  with  the  task  at  hand.

Except  for  the  introduction  of  a  tentative 

hypothesis  in  l i ne  4  above,  and  the  fact  that  l i t e r a ls 
are  processed  on  a  f i r s t - i n - f i r s t - o ut  basis, 
derivation  follows  the  usual 
form  of  a  linear  deduc­
t i on  as  previously  described.  The  abduction  task  is 
completed  when  no  remaining  subgoals  occur  to  the 
r i g ht  of  the  v e r t i c al  bar;  any  terms  occurring  to 
the  l e ft  of  the  bar  at  that  juncture  constitute  the 
basis  f or  a  diagnostic  model.

It  may  be  of  some  interest  to  follow  the  course 

is  that  some  as  yet 

of  development  of  the  diagnosis  in  the  case  i l l u s­
trated  above. 
In  l i ne  4,  where  the  synthesis  step 
occurs,  what  is  hypothesized 
unknown  process  affecting  an  unspecified  structure  is 
responsible  for  both  of  the  observed  symptoms.  The 
instantiations  that  then  take  place  in  the  f i n al  two 
steps  of  this  derivation  entail  contributions  from 
the  search  trees  developed  from  each  of  the  root 
nodes; 
synthetic 

thus  the  proposed  diagnosis  represents  a  true 

inference. 

A  hypothesis  developed  on  the  basis  of  such  a 
in  general,  not  a  unique  explanation 

procedure  i s, 
of  the  data,  and  the  problem  then  becomes  one  of 
discrimination,  among  contending  diagnoses.  This 
phase  of  the  problem  entails  the  use  of  deductive, 
as  w e ll  as  abductive  l o g i c.  Once  a  diagnostic  model 
has  been  proposed, 
it  can  be  used  to  generate  pre-
dictions  of  additional  unreported  manifestations  of 
for  example,  in  the 
the  assumed  pathology.  Thus, 
case  i l l u s t r a t ed  above,  the  presumption  of  a  l i v er 
abscess  can  be  used  to  deduce  the  prediction  of 
jaundice  (on  the  basis  of  axiom  5).  Such  predictions 
can  then  be  subjected  to  empirical  v e r i f i c a t i o n. 
Any  new  observational  data  can  then  be  fed  back  via 
the  abduction  procedure  through  another  i t e r a t i on  of 
the  cycle  -  giving  r i s e,  perhaps, 
potheses  that  may  in  turn  generate  new  predictions, 
leading  to  new  observations,  and  so  f o r t h.

the  basic  paradigms  of  human  cognitive,  and  problem

basically  synthetic  in  nature  entails  the  use  of

those  episodes  of  comprehension  and  planning  that 
arise  in  the  course  of  any  r e al  problem-solving  act.
