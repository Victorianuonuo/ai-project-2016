Abstract

This paper characterizes the complexity of the core
in coalitional games. There are different propos-
als for representing coalitional games in a compact
way, where the worths of coalitions may be com-
puted in polynomial time. In all those frameworks,
it was shown that core non-emptiness is a co-NP-
hard problem. However, for the most general of
them, it was left as an open problem whether it
belongs to co-NP or it actually is an harder prob-
lem. We solve this open problem in a positive way;
indeed, we are able to show that, for the case of
transferable payoffs, the problem belongs to co-NP
for any compact representation of the game where
the worths of coalitions may be computed in poly-
nomial time (also, non-deterministic polynomial
time), encompassing all previous proposals of this
kind. This is proved by showing that games with
empty cores have small infeasibility certiﬁcates.
The picture is completed by looking at coalitional
games with non-transferable payoffs. We propose
a compact representation based on marginal contri-
bution nets. Also in this case, we are able to set-
tle the precise complexity of core non-emptiness,
which turns out to be ΣP

2 -complete.

1 Introduction
Coalitional games model situations where groups of players
can cooperate in order to obtain certain worths, and have been
extensively used to study applicative scenarios in economics
and social sciences [Aumann and Hart, 1992]. Also, coali-
tional games are interesting in distributed AI, multi-agent
systems and electronic commerce [Ieong and Shoham, 2005;
Conitzer and Sandholm, 2004].

In coalitional games, a nonempty set of players joining to-
gether is called a coalition. The coalition including all the

players is called grand-coalition. The players know the worth
that any coalition would get. A feasible solution for a coali-
tional game is an allowed way to assign worths (also payoffs)
to all players. In the literature, a number of deﬁnitions of a
feasible solution have been described. Each of them propose
some way to assign worths to single players. Note that, in this
formal context, the actions taken by players are not modeled.
There are two basic types of coalitional games [Osborne
and Rubinstein, 1994]: Coalitional Games with transferable
payoffs (or TU Games) and Coalitional Games with non-
transferable payoffs (or NTU Games).
In the former type
of games, players forming a coalition can obtain a certain
amount of worth they can distribute among themselves. In
the latter type, a coalition guarantees a speciﬁc set of conse-
quences that assign to its players a set of possible payoffs.

For both game types, a fundamental issue is distributing
payoffs amongst participating players, which mirrors in sev-
eral interesting applications [Aumann and Hart, 1992]. And,
in fact, several ways of distributing utilities have been pro-
posed, which are usually referred to as solution concepts (see,
e.g., [Aumann and Hart, 1992] for a list of deﬁnitions). One
solution concept is that of the core, which forces distribu-
tions that are, in a sense, “stable”, that is, no subsets of play-
ers improve their worths by leaving the grand-coalition. The
core, which can be seen as an analogous of the Nash equilib-
rium for coalitional games [Osborne and Rubinstein, 1994],
is probably the most important solution concept deﬁned for
such games (see, e.g., [Aumann, 2005]). Therefore, it is a
signiﬁcant issue singling out those games featuring a non-
empty core, that are, games where the worth distribution can
be arranged in such a way that the grand-coalition is “stable”.
On the other hand, analyzing the computational complexity
of solution concepts of games is an important class of prob-
lems for computer science [Papadimitriou, 2001].

In order to represent and reason about coalitional games,
a way to represent the associations of coalitions with their
worths is needed: doing it explicitly is unfeasible, since list-
ing all those associations would require exponential space in
the number of players. In this sense, the literature proposes a
number of compact representation schemes of the worth func-
tion. For instance, Papadimitriou and Deng (1994) consider
TU games where players are encoded as nodes in an arc-
weighted graph, and the worth of a coalition s is computed
as the sum of the weights of the arcs connecting players in s.

IJCAI-07

1402

A more general and more expressive representation for
TU games has been recently proposed by Ieong and Shoham
(2005), where the encoding is done using marginal contribu-
tion nets, i.e., ﬁnite sets of weighted rules, where the coali-
tion worth is given by the sum of the weights of the logical
rules triggered by its members. In both these settings, check-
ing non-emptiness of the core was shown to be co-NP-hard,
whereas in the latter—more general—setting it was left as an
open problem to settle its precise complexity.

In dealing with this open question, this paper provides
an answer to the rather more general question of establish-
ing the complexity of checking core non-emptiness (in both
the transferable and the non-transferable payoffs settings) for
all those compact game representations satisfying the (quite
weak) constraint that the associated worth function is com-
putable in FNP (and, thus, as a special case, in polynomial
time, as in the two above mentioned frameworks).

Note that our representation scheme encompasses all other
compact schemes we are aware of but the one described in
[Conitzer and Sandholm, 2006] for TU games, where com-
puting the worth of a coalition is harder than FNP—the inter-
ested reader is referred to that paper for a thorough overview
about compact representation schemes. Note, moreover, that
for some of such compact representation schemes, the com-
plexity of checking core non-emptiness was already estab-
lished [Conitzer and Sandholm, 2006; Deng and Papadim-
itriou, 1994] (for instance, it is shown to be co-NP-complete
in the setting given in [Deng and Papadimitriou, 1994]).

In order to prove our complexity results for TU games, we
show that if the game core is empty, then there exists a small
infeasibility certiﬁcate that proves it, thereby showing that for
games of the quite general form we consider here, the prob-
lem of checking core non-emptiness is in co-NP (Note that
this provides the answer to the problem left open in [Ieong
and Shoham, 2005]). This is done by providing some results
about the properties of polyhedra induced by games.

Furthermore, we consider NTU games, by deﬁning a
new compact game form, which is obtained by generalizing
marginal contribution nets [Ieong and Shoham, 2005] to the
non-transferable payoffs setting. For such games, we are able
to show that checking core non-emptiness is ΣP
2 -hard, and
also that this problem can be solved in ΣP
2 even for general
games of this form, thereby settling the ΣP
2 -completeness of
the problem in the non-transferable payoffs setting.

2 Preliminaries

In this section we deﬁne our formal framework of reference.

outcomes for a coalitional game: the core is one of the best
known, as it represents a stable solution, from which players
have no incentive to deviate. Let n = |N |. A proﬁle ¯x for N
is a vector of reals (¯x1, . . . , ¯xn), which represents a possible
way to assign payoffs to players. For a coalition of players
s ⊆ N , deﬁne ¯x(s) ≡
¯xi. Then, ¯x is said a feasible
payoff proﬁle if ¯x(N ) = v(N ), that is, payoffs distributed
among the players should be equal to the payoff available for
the grand-coalition. The core is deﬁned as follows:

(cid:2)

i∈s

Deﬁnition 2.2. The core of a coalitional game with transfer-
able payoffs (cid:2)N, v(cid:3) is the set of all feasible payoff proﬁles ¯x
such that, for all coalitions s ⊆ N , ¯x(s) ≥ v(s).

It immediately follows from the deﬁnition above that the
core is the set of all vectors ¯x ∈ (cid:5)n that satisfy the following
2n inequalities:(cid:3)

xi ≥ v(s),

∀s ⊆ N ∧ s (cid:12)= ∅

i∈s

(cid:3)

i∈N

xi ≤ v(N ),

(2.1)

(2.2)

where the last inequality, combined with its opposite in (2.1),
enforces the feasibility of computed proﬁles.

2.2 Non-transferable Payoffs
In coalitional NTU games each coalition is associated to a set
of possible outcomes or consequences:

Deﬁnition 2.3. A Coalitional Game without transferable
payoff is a four-tuple (cid:2)N, X, v, ((cid:2)i)

(cid:3), where:

i∈N

• N is a ﬁnite set of players;
• X is the set of all possible consequences;
• v : s → 2X is a function that assigns, to any coalition

s ⊆ N of players, a set of consequences v(s) ⊆ X;

• ((cid:2)i)

i∈N is the set of all preference relations (cid:2)i on X,

for each player i ∈ N .

It is easy to see that coalitional games with transferable
payoffs can be seen as special cases of coalitional games
without transferable payoffs [Osborne and Rubinstein, 1994].
Also, the deﬁnition of the core for those latter games is an ex-
tension of that given in deﬁnition 2.2:

Deﬁnition 2.4. The core of the coalitional game without
(cid:3) is the set of all ¯x ∈
transferable payoffs (cid:2)N, X, v, ((cid:2)i)
v(N ) such that there is no coalition s ⊆ N with a ¯y ∈ v(s)
such that ¯y (cid:15)i ¯x for all i ∈ s.

i∈N

2.1 Transferable Payoffs

3 Compact Representations

Games of interest in this paper are formally deﬁned next.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A Coalitional Game with transferable payoffs
is a pair (cid:2)N, v(cid:3) where

• N is the ﬁnite set of players;
• v is a function that associates with every coalition s a

real number v(s) (the worth of s) (v : 2N → (cid:5)).

An outcome for a coalitional game speciﬁes payoffs for all
players. A solution concept is a way to select “reasonable”

We now discuss compact representation forms, beginning
with marginal contribution nets [Ieong and Shoham, 2005].

Rules in a marginal contribution net are in the form

pattern → value

where a pattern is a conjunction that may include both posi-
tive and negative literals, with each literal denoting a player.
A rule is said to apply to a coalition s if all the player liter-
als occurring positively in the pattern are also in s and all the

IJCAI-07

1403

player literals occurring negatively in the pattern do not be-
long to s. When more than one rule applies to a coalition, the
value for that coalition is given by the contribution of all those
rules, i.e., by the sum of their values. Vice versa, if no rule
applies to a given coalition, then the value for that coalition is
set to zero by default. For example, with rules:

a ∧ b → 5,

b → 2,

a ∧ ¬b → 3,

we obtain v({a}) = 3 (the third rule applies), v({b}) = 2
(the second rule applies), and v({a, b}) = 5 + 2 = 7 (both
the ﬁrst and the second rules apply). Using this representa-
tion scheme, games can be much more succinct than the so
called characteristic form, where all the 2n − 1 values of the
worth function should be explicitly listed. In any case, given
such a game encoding G and any coalition s, the worth v(s)
can be computed in linear time, that is, in O(||G|| + ||s||),
which is also O(||G||), where ||G|| denotes the size of G. As
observed in [Ieong and Shoham, 2005], their representation
scheme is fully expressive, in that it allows to represent any
TU coalitional game, and there are games where it is expo-
nentially more succinct than previous proposals, such as the
multi-issue representation of [Conitzer and Sandholm, 2004].
For completeness, note that there are games where the size of
any possible marginal nets encoding has almost the same size
as the characteristic form.

Next, we are going to introduce a new and general compact
representation scheme of coalitional games, a scheme where
it is just required the worth function to be computable in FNP,
that is, computable in polynomial time by a non-deterministic
Turing transducer [Papadimitriou, 1994].

Formally, let C be a class of games with transferable (resp.,
non-transferable) payoffs as deﬁned by a certain given encod-
ing scheme. Deﬁne the worth (consequence) relation for C as
the set of tuples WC = {(cid:2)G, s, w(cid:3) | G ∈ C, vG(s) = w}
(resp., WC = {(cid:2)G, s, w(cid:3) | G ∈ C, w ∈ vG(s)}). We say that
WC is polynomial-time computable if there is a positive inte-
ger k and a deterministic polynomial time transducer M that,
given any game encoding G ∈ C and a coalition s of players
of G, outputs a value w (resp. all consequences w) such that
(cid:2)G, s, w(cid:3) ∈ WC in at most ||(cid:2)G, s(cid:3)||k steps.

We say that WC is non-deterministically polynomial-time
computable if there is a positive integer k such that WC is k-
balanced and k-decidable, as deﬁned below. A worth (conse-
quence) relation WC is k-balanced if ||w|| ≤ ||(cid:2)G, s(cid:3)||k, while
it is said k-decidable if there is a non-deterministic Turing
machine that decides WC in at most ||(cid:2)G, s, w(cid:3)||k time. It then
follows that there is a non-deterministic Turing transducer M
that may compute in O(||(cid:2)G, s(cid:3)||k) time the worth v(s) (resp.
some consequence in v(s)) of any coalition s of players of
G. Indeed, M guesses such a value w and a witness y of the
correctness of this value (note that WC ∈ NP), and then ver-
iﬁes in deterministic polynomial time that (cid:2)G, s, w(cid:3) ∈ WC,
possibly exploiting the witness y.
Deﬁnition 3.1. Let C(R) be the class of all games encoded
according to some compact representation R. We say that R
is a (non-deterministic) polynomial-time compact representa-
tion if the worth relation for C(R) is (non-deterministically)
polynomial-time computable.

For instance, the extension of the marginal nets framework
to games with non-transferable payoffs, presented in Sec-
tion 6, is a non-deterministic polynomial-time compact rep-
resentation, whereas both the above mentioned schemes of
[Deng and Papadimitriou, 1994] and of [Ieong and Shoham,
2005] are polynomial time representations since, given a
game G encoded either as a weighted graph, or as a marginal
contribution net, and given any coalition s, the worth of s in
G can be computed in polynomial time in the size of G and s.
Our membership proofs for the core non-emptiness prob-
lem will be given in the most general setting of non-determin-
istic polynomial-time compact representations.

4 Separating Polyhedra

Because of (2.1) and (2.2), the core of a coalitional game with
transferable payoffs and n players is a polyhedral set of (cid:5)n.
In this section, we prove some nice properties of polyhedral
sets that will be useful to deal with such games.

4.1 Preliminaries on Polyhedral Sets

We next give some useful deﬁnitions and facts about polyhe-
dral sets. We refer the interested reader to any book on this
subject for further readings (see, e.g., [Gr¨unbaum, 1967]).

Let n > 0 be any natural number. A Polyhedral Set (or
Polyhedron) P of (cid:5)n is the intersection of a ﬁnite set S of
closed halfspaces of (cid:5)n. Note that in this paper we always
assume, unless otherwise stated, that n > 0. We denote this
polyhedron by Pol(S) and we denote S by Half(P ).

Recall that a hyperplane H of (cid:5)n is a set of points {x ∈
(cid:5)n|aT x = b}, where a ∈ (cid:5)n and b ∈ (cid:5). The closed half-
is the set of points {x ∈ (cid:5)n|aT x ≥ b}. We say
space H
. We denote the points that do not
that these points satisfy H
−
+ = {x ∈

(cid:5)n|aT x < b}. Note that H
is an open halfspace. We say

and H

Let P be a polyhedron and H a hyperplane. Then, H cuts
contain points of P , and we say that H
P if both H
passes through P , if there is a non-empty touching set C =
H ∩ P . Furthermore, we say that H supports P , or that it is a
supporting hyperplane for P , if H does not cut P , but passes
through P , i.e., it just touches P , as the only common points
of H and P are those in their intersection C.

+

Moreover, we say that H

is a supporting halfspace for P
if H is a supporting hyperplane for P and P ⊆ H
. Note
that P ⊆ Pol(S) for any set of halfspaces S ⊆ Half(P ),
since the latter polyhedron is obtained from the intersection
of a smaller set of halfspaces than P . We say that such a
polyhedron is a supporting polyhedron for P .

Recall that, for any set A ⊆ (cid:5)n, its dimension dim(A) is
the dimension of its afﬁne hull. For instance, if A consists
of two points, or it is a segment, its afﬁne hull is a line and
thus dim(A) = 1. By deﬁnition, dim(∅) = −1, while single
points have dimension 0.

A set F ⊆ P is a face of P if either F = ∅, or F = P , or
if there exists a supporting hyperplane HF of P such that F

is their touching set, i.e., F = HF ∩ P . In the latter case, we
say that F is a proper face of P . A facet of P is a proper face
of P with the largest possible dimension, that is, dim(P ) − 1.
The following facts are well known [Gr¨unbaum, 1967]:

1. For any facet F of P , there is a halfspace H

such that F = H

+ ∩ P . We say that H

+

+ ∈ Half(P )
generates F .

2. For any proper face F of P , there is a facet F

(cid:3)

of P such

(cid:3)

that F ⊆ F
(cid:3)
3. If F and F

.
are two proper faces of P and F ⊂ F

(cid:3)

, then

dim(F ) < dim(F

(cid:3)).

4.2 Separating Polyhedra from a Few Supporting

Halfspaces

Lemma 4.1. Let P be a polyhedron of (cid:5)n with dim(P ) = n,
+
and H
F a supporting halfspace of P whose touching set is
F . Then, there exists a set of halfspaces HF ⊆ Half(P ) such
+
that |HF | ≤ n − dim(F ), H
F is a supporting halfspace of
P ol(HF ), and their touching set C is such that F ⊆ C.

+
F

Proof. (Rough Sketch.) The proof is by induction. Base
case: If dim(F ) = n − 1 we have that the touching face F =
∩ P is a facet of P . Thus, from Fact 1, F is generated by
H
+ ∩ P = F , as
some halfspace H
for HF . Since dim(F ) = dim(H) = dim(HF ) = n − 1, it
+
easily follows that in fact H = HF holds. Thus, H

spaces taken from Half(P ), and H
F (cid:2)(cid:2) does not belong to this

mond, and hence the property immediately holds (base case).
In general, the procedure may continue, encountering each
time at least one facet by fact 2, and one more face with a
higher dimension than the current one by fact 3. Eventually,
in our example we get HF = {H

5 Small Emptiness Certiﬁcates for the Core

In this section, we prove our main results on TU games.

With a little abuse of notations, since coalitions correspond
to the inequalities (2.1) and hence to the associated halfspaces
of (cid:5)n, hereafter we use these terms interchangeably.
Deﬁnition 5.1. Let G = (cid:2)N, v(cid:3) be a game with transferable
payoffs. A coalition set S ⊆ 2N is a certiﬁcate of emptiness
(or infeasibility certiﬁcate) for the core of G if the intersection
of Pol(S) with the grand-coalition halfspace (2.2) is empty.

The deﬁnition above is motivated by the following obser-
vation. Let P be the polyhedron of (cid:5)n obtained as the inter-
section of all halfspaces (2.1). Since S is a subset of all pos-
sible coalitions, P ⊆ Pol(S). Therefore, if the intersection of
Pol(S) with the grand-coalition halfspace (2.2) is empty, the
intersection of this halfspace with P is empty, as well.

the certiﬁcate is n. In our three-dimensional example, such a

Note that the above proof is constructive and has a nice
geometrical interpretation. However, for the sake of com-
pleteness, we point out that—as we have recently found—the
above result on infeasibility certiﬁcates may be also obtained
as a consequence of Helly’s Theorem on the intersection of
families of convex sets [Danzer et al., 1963], whose proof is
rather different, as it relies on algebraic techniques.

Exploiting the above property, we can now state our gen-
eral result on the complexity of core non-emptiness for any
(non-deterministic) polynomial-time compact representation.
Theorem 5.3. Let R be a non-deterministic polynomial-time
compact representation. Given any coalitional game with
transferable payoffs G ∈ C(R), deciding whether the core
of G is not empty is in co-NP.
Proof. Let G = (cid:2)N, v(cid:3) be a game with transferable payoffs.
If its core is empty, from Theorem 5.2, there is an infeasibility
certiﬁcate S, with |S| ≤ n, where n is the number of players
of G. For the sake of presentation, let us brieﬂy sketch the
case of a polynomial-time deterministic representation R. In
this case, a non-deterministic Turing machine may check in
polynomial time that the core is empty by performing the fol-
lowing operations: (i) guessing the set S, i.e., the coalitions
of players corresponding to the halfspaces in S; (ii) compu-
tating (in deterministic polynomial time) the worth v(s), for
each s ∈ S, and for the grand-coalition N ; and (iii) checking
+
that Pol(S) ∩ H
P is the halfspace deﬁned
by the grand-coalition inequality (2.2). Note that the last step
is feasible in polynomial time, as we have to solve a linear
system consisting of just n + 1 inequalities.

The case of a non-deterministic polynomial-time compact
representation R is a simple variation where, at step (ii), for
each s ∈ S, the machine should also guess the value w =
v(s) and a witness y that (cid:2)G, s, w(cid:3) ∈ WC(R).

The above result settles the precise complexity of the core
non-emptiness problem for marginal contribution nets, as
asked for in [Ieong and Shoham, 2005].
Corollary 5.4. Given a coalitional game with transferable
payoffs encoded as a marginal contribution net, deciding
whether its core is not empty is co-NP-complete.

6 Non-Transferable Payoffs Increase the

Complexity

For games where the payoffs cannot be transferred among the
players, core non-emptiness turns out to be harder than in the
case of transferable payoffs we have studied above.

First, for NTU games we next deﬁne a notation similar
to that of marginal contribution nets, to describe the conse-
quences of these games in a compact form.

Also here, games are described by associating player pat-
terns with consequences, a coalition worth being thus char-
acterized by the sums of the contributions of the rules whose
patterns are satisﬁed by the players in the coalition.
Deﬁnition 6.1. A marginal contribution net for game with
non-transferable payoffs is a ﬁnite set of rules of the form

pattern → consequences,

where pattern is a conjunction of positive and negative player
literals, and consequences is a set of possible payoff addenda
for the players in the coalition that trigger this rule, that is, for
players occurring as positive literals in pattern.

Formally, given such a rule r, we say that a coalition s of
players meets its pattern, if each player occurring positively
in pattern also occurs in s, and none of the players occur-
ring negatively in pattern occurs in s. The consequences of r
are a set of vectors assigning an increment (either positive or
negative) to some players occurring positively in pattern. All
other players get no increment out of this vector. Syntacti-
cally, we thus specify only the contributions for the players to
be incremented (see example below). For each player p, there
is a default implicitly speciﬁed rule, which is triggered by the
player p and assigns to it the (initial) value 0. Then, the only
consequence of coalitions that do not meet any non-default
rule is the outcome assigning payoff 0 to all their players.

Let s be a coalition and R the set of rules that s meets.
The set of consequences v(s) of s is the set of all imputation
vectors that can be obtained by taking the sum of any tuple
of vectors ¯x1, . . . , ¯x|R|, with each ¯xi belonging to the conse-
quences of some rule ri ∈ R.
Example 6.2. Let us consider a game involving players a, b
and c. Then, consider the rules

a ∧ b → [a+=1], [a+=2, b+=1]
b ∧ ¬c → [b+=4].

Then the set of consequences v({a}) is the singleton
{(0, 0, 0)}, since only the implicit default rules apply. On
the other hand, v({a, b}) = {(1, 4, 0), (2, 5, 0)}, v{b, c} =
{(0, 0, 0)}, and v({a, b, c}) = {(1, 0, 0), (2, 1, 0)}.

(cid:3) be a game in C(R) with non-transferable
(cid:2)N, X, v, ((cid:2)i)
payoffs. A non-deterministic Turing machine with an ora-
cle in NP may decide in polynomial time that the core is not
empty as follows: (i) guessing the proﬁle w ∈ v(N ) and of
a witness y that w is a consequence of v(N ); (ii) exploiting
y, checking in polynomial time that (cid:2)G, N, w(cid:3) ∈ WC(R); and
(iii) exploiting the oracle, checking that w belongs to the core.
Indeed, it is easy to see that the latter problem is in co-NP.

(Membership in co-NP). If R is a deterministic polyno-
mial-time compact representation, a non-deterministic Tur-
ing machine M may decide in polynomial time that the core
is empty as follows.
It computes in polynomial time all
consequences of the grand-coalition and guesses, for each
w ∈ v(N ), a witness yw that w is not in the core. Then,
exploiting these witnesses, M checks in polynomial time that
all such proﬁles do not belong to the core.

2 -hardness). The reduction is from the problem of de-
ciding the validity of 2QBF formulae in 3DNF. Let Φ =
∃α∀βφ(α, β), where α and β are vectors of boolean vari-
ables, and φ(α, β) is a boolean formula in 3DNF. From Φ,
we build in polynomial time the following NTU game GΦ,
encoded as a marginal contribution net. The players of GΦ
are: two players aT
i , called existential players, cor-
responding to each variable αi of Φ; two players bT
i and bF
i ,
called universal players, for each variable βi of Φ; a player di
for each disjunct δi of Φ; and two more players sat and good,
where the former is related to the satisﬁability of φ(α, β),
while the latter is a player that receives a penalty −B in coali-
tions that do not behave as we would like to, where B is a
ﬁxed number larger than any value that any coalitions may
achieve.

i and aF

For any literal (cid:6) occurring in some disjunct of the formula,
denote by p(l) the corresponding player of the game. E.g., if
(cid:6) = ¬αi, then p((cid:6)) = aF
i . Then,
the consequences for coalitions in GΦ are deﬁned through the
following rules:

Then, it can be shown that Φ is valid if and only GΦ has
a non empty core. First note that any imputation vector for
the grand-coalition N assigns 1 to universal players, disjunct
players, and to sat and good. For any pair of existential play-
ers aT
i , they get either 0 or 1 but never the same value.
Then, we can associate with such a conﬁguration of existen-
tial players a truth-value assignment for the corresponding
boolean variables: if ¯x is an imputation vector, deﬁne σ¯x such
that σ¯x(αi) = true if aT
takes 0 in ¯x, and σ¯x(αi) = false
takes 0 in ¯x. Intuitively, if the formula is valid then σ¯x
if aF
is a witness of validity, and there is such an imputation vec-
tor ¯x in the core. Indeed, in this case, to improve the payoff
for all of its members, a coalition should avoid to include sat.
However, this is impossible if Φ is valid.
