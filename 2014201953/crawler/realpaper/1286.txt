Minimal VL1 .Formulas 

In  general,  there  can  be  a  large  number  of  VL1 

formulas  which  express  a  given  VL  function.  Therefore, 
a  problem  arises  of  how  to  construct  a  formula,  which 
is  minimal  under  an  assumed  cost  (or  optimality) 
functional, 

Cost  functionals  are  usually  stated  as  a  linear 
function  of  certain  parameters  multiplied  by  weights 
oeing  real  numbers.  Such  functionals  can,  however,  be 
inconvenient  from  the  computational,  and,  as  w e l l,  the 
application  viewpoint  (they  require  multiplication  and 
addition  operations,  which  can  be  a  disadvantage  when 
a  large  set  is  searched,  and  it 
is  often  d i f f i c u lt  to 
state  weights  which  r e f l e ct  w e ll  the

VL1 Formulas  as  Classification  Rules  (Examples) 

In  t h is  chapter  ve  i l l u s t r a t e,  by  two  examples,  an 

application  of  the  VL1  system  to  the  synthesis  of 
c l a s s i f i c a t i on  rules.  The  examples  are  very  simple; 
t h e ir  purpose  is  to  provide  an  insight  i n to  the 
p r i n c i p l e s,  rather  than  to  investigate  the  boundaries 
of  application  p o s s i b i l i t i e s. 

Example  1 

Suppose  there  is  given  a  set  of  eight  objects,  as 

shown  in  Figure  2,  and  it  is  known  (relation  T) 
those  denoted 
name  1  { b r i e f l y,  class  1),  and  those  denoted 
class  0. 

that 
belong  to  the  class  w i th  numerical 
to 

The  problem  is  to  f i nd  the  simplest 

(in  some 

specified  sense)  r u l e,  which  characterizes  objects  of 
class  1  as  opposed  to  objects  of  class  0. 

(To  make  the  problem  clearly  understood,  Suppose 
that  objects  were.mixed  up.  The  r u l e,  which  is  to  be 
found,  could  then  be  used  to  restore  the  o r i g i n al 
c l a s s i f i c a t i on  w i th  the  minimum  cost—according  to 
some  cost  functional. ) 

In  order  to  apply  the  VL1  system  to  t h is  problem, 
a ll  objects  should  be  described  by  sequences  of  values 
of  certain  variables,  that 
is,  by  events  or  event  sets 
of  some  event  space  E(h1,  h 2 . ..  ,hn).  Then  the  problem 
becomes  that  of  f i n d i ng  a  VL1  expression  for  a  function 

f:  E(h1,h2,...,hn)  -  (0,1) 

(31) 

such  that  f(e)  =  0,1  for  e  E  RO,  R  ,  respectively, 
where; 

0,1  -  represent  classes  0  and  1,  respectively 

RO,R1  -  are  event  sets  representing  objects  of

respectively. 

Suppose  that  some  specialized  procedures  have  been 

developed  which  can  i d e n t i fy  in  the  objects  such  com(cid:173)
ponents  as  rectangles,  t r i a n g l e s,  trapezoids,  c i r c l e s, 
and  e l l i p s e s. 

A  simple  description  of  every  object  could  then 
be  by  specifying  how  many  times  each  such  component 
appears  in  every  object.  Let  us  accept,  as  a  f i r st 
t r i a l,  t h is  kind  of  description  as  object  representa(cid:173)

the  p r e v i o us 

(Bote 

Let  us  now  try  to  extend  the  universe  of 

representations  to  obtain  a  disjoint  representation  of 
objects.  An  obvious  way  to  do  so  seems  to  also 
include  in  the  object  descriptions  information  about 
spacial  relationships  between  object  parts.  Suppose 
that  the  specialized  procedures  not  only  can  name  the 
object  parts,  but  also  can  determine  binary  relations 
such  as  'on  the  l e ft  o f,  'contains',  'on  top  of 
between  adjacent  object  components.  New  variables 
have,  therefore,  to  be  introduced.  Let  x6,  x7,  and  x8 
be  variables  such  that:  X6,  and x7, represent  the  l e ft 
and  right  elements  (object  components),  respectively, 
in  a  binary  relation  which  relates  any  two  adjacent 
components.  Their  domains, H6 and  H  ,  are  sets  of 
numerical  names  of  a ll  object  components  which  can  be 
distinguished  and  uniquely  named  in  any  object: 
H6 = H7 = {0,1,...........,7), where 0 represents a rectangle, 
1  -  a  triangle  or  a  l e ft  triangle  if  there  are  two 
triangles,  2  -  a  right  triangle  if  there  are  two 
triangles,  3  -  a  trapezoid,  4  -  a  circle,  5  -  a  left 
or  upper  circle  if  there  are  two  circles,  6  -  the 
right  or  lower  circle  if  there  are  two  circles,  f  -
an  ellipse;  X8  represents  binary  relations  between  the 
values  of  x6  and x7, if  these  values  are  names  of 
adjacent  components  in  an  object. 
consists  of  numerical  names  of  those  relations  (from 
a  universe  of  relations  which  specialized  procedures 
can  detect), which  actually  appear  between  adjacent
