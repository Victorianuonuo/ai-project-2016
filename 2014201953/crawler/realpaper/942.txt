Abstract 

Social  law  is  perceived  as  evolving  through  the 
competition  of individual  social strategies held  by 
the  agents.  A  strategy  with  strong  authority, 
accepted by many agents, will tend to diffuse to the 
remaining agents. The authority of a social strategy 
is  determined  by  not  only  the  number  of  but  also 
the collective social positions of its overlaid agents. 
This  paper  presents  a  novel  collective  strategy 
diffusion  model  in  agent  social  law  evolution.  In 
the  model,  social  strategies  that  have  strong 
authority  are  impressed  on  the  other  agents.  The 
agents  will  accept  (partially  or  in  full)  or  reject 
them based on their own social strategies and social 
positions.  The  diffusion  of  social  strategies 
proceeds  in  a  series  of  steps  and  the  final  result 
depends on the interplay between the forces driving 
diffusion and the counteracting forces.

1  Introduction 
Coordination  is  the  key  to  develop  realistic  multiagent 
systems [Kraus, 1997][Jiang & Jiang, 2005]. The concept of 
artificial  social  system  is  presented  by  [Shoham  and 
Tennenholtz,  1995]; 
to  add  a 
mechanism,  called  a  social  law,  into  the  system  to  realize 
coordination among agents. Each agent initially has its own 
strategy,  and  the  different  strategies  may  produce  conflict. 
Therefore,  to  realize  a  harmonious  agent  system,  we  will 
need to endow a set of social laws that can be accepted by 
most agents. A set of social laws represents restrictions on 
final  agent  strategies.  Previous  work  on  artificial  social 
systems  [Shoham  &  Tennenholtz,  1997]  [Shoham  and 
Tennenholtz,1995] [Fitoussi and Tennenholtz, 2000] [Boella 
and  van  der  Torre,  2005]  made  no  systematic  analyses  on 
the evolution of social laws from individual social strategies, 
and  the  social  laws  were  created  off-line.  Therefore,  the 
social laws described in previous work are always fixed, and 
so fail to yield dynamic agent systems. 

This paper presents that social laws aren’t fixed over the 
system’s  lifetime.  A  social  law  represents  an  island  of 
stability  and  can  be  overwhelmed  and  replaced.  In  the 
framework  presented  by  this  paper,  agents  start  with  their 
individual social strategies; the social strategies can diffuse 

and be accepted in part or in full by others. The emergence 
of a new dominant social strategy represents the emergence 
of a new social law. 

We  initiated  a  study  on  how  to  evolve  individual  social 
strategies  to  global  social  law  through  hierarchical  agent 
diffusion [Jiang and Ishida, 2006][Jiang and Ishida, 2007]. 
In  our  original  model,  each  agent  has  its  own  social 
strategies at the first stage of the system; for simplicity we 
restrict the discussion to just one action/belief. Further, we 
assume that the agents possess “social rank” and the ranks 
are known by all agents. As the system runs, the strategies 
of  superior  agents  will  tend  to  diffuse  (be  adopted  by  or 
accepted  by)  the  junior  agents.  Given  the  right  conditions 
and  enough  time,  a  global  social  law  may  be  finally 
established. A simple example is given below: 

Two  businessmen  enter  the  same  conference  room.  One 
starts to smoke but the other complains. Upon learning that 
the smoker has a higher position in the same company, the 
complainer  changes  his  strategy  of  “smoking  is  not 
permitted” to “go ahead.” This means that the social law in 
the  conference  room  has  become  “smoking  is  permitted”. 
[Scenario 1: diffusion by rank] 

Only  the  diffusion  of  the  social  strategies  of  superior 
agents to junior agents was considered in [Jiang and Ishida, 
2006][ Jiang and Ishida, 2007]. However, such a situation is 
not truly representative of reality. In real society, there are 
so  many  collective  intentions  and  practices  [Balzer  and 
Tuomela, 2003][Pacheco and Carmo, 2003], and the social 
strategies  shared  by  many  junior  agents  can  also  influence 
the  superior  agents.  The  following  example  demonstrates 
this:  

You like smoking very  much and  you occupy  the highest 
position  in your  company.  However,  if  all  other  members 
dislike  smoking,  you  will  probably  stop  smoking, i.e.  your 
social  strategy  has  been  trumped  by  that  of  the  majority. 
Therefore,  the  social  law  of  your  office  is  now  “no 
smoking”. 
[Scenario 2: diffusion by numbers] 

The interplay between rank, strength of strategy support, 
and  the  numbers  of  supporters  is  extremely  complex.  The 
emergence  of  a  social  law  may  not  prevent  some  agents 
from maintaining their original strategies or indeed adopting 
contra-strategies. For example: 

IJCAI-07

1353

 

None  of  the  employees  in  an  office  like  smoking;  so  the 
social  law  in  the  office  is  “no  smoking  in  the  office”.  The 
boss  starts  a  long discussion with  the employees.  The boss 
has  a  habit:  he  likes  to  smoke  while  giving  orders  to  the 
staff. Therefore, the boss will smoke even though the social 
law is “no smoking in the office”.  
[Scenario 3: persistence of outliers]  

In such a scenario, the outlier agent has a very high social 
position; so its corresponding social strategy may have high 
dominance though the number of overlaid agents is few (just 
one in this case). 

All  three  scenarios  are  common  in  real  world  social 
strategy diffusion. We think that the dominance of a social 
strategy  is  determined  by  the  numbers  and  ranking  of  its 
supporters  relative  to  those  of  other  strategies.  A  strategy 
becomes  more  dominant  as 
the  number  of  adopters 
increases  and/or  their  ranking  increases.  The  success  of  a 
social  strategy  supported  by  many  junior  agents  over  the 
social  strategy  of  superior  agents  can  be  called  collective 
insurgent  diffusion;  the  reverse  is  called  collective  elite 
diffusion.  

In this paper, we explore how a social strategy can diffuse 
among agents. Our model is explained using the example of 
crowd orientation.  

2.  An Example and Related Concepts 

2.1 Social Strategy in Queue Orientation 
To  explain  our  model,  we  use  the  example  of  an  agent 
system  that  reproduces  a  crowd  of  strangers  standing  on  a 
soccer  field.  At  the  initial  stage,  the  orientation  of  each 
agent (its strategy) is quite random. What we are looking for 
the  emergence  of  a  social  law;  most  agents  face  the  same 
direction.

Figure 1: The case of an agent system and its social strategies 

 

Each  of  the  n  agents  can  stand  with  one  of  the  8 
orientations,  see  Figure  1  (a).  The  social  strategy  of  an 
agent  is  its orientation. Let n be the number of agents, we 
can  use  an  array  to  denote  the  social  strategies  of  agents. 
n , represents social strategy (i.e. the 
is

,8},1

{1,

i

standing orientation) of agent i. The social strategies of the 
agents  in  (b)  are  shown  as  (c).  Obviously,  the  standing 
orientations of the agents in Figure 1 (b) are disorderly.  

Since  our  example  consists  of  strangers,  now  we  may 
replace explicit social rank with age. For example, if agent c 
looks  older  than  e,  then  e  may  change  its  orientation  to 
match that of c. If agents b and d share the same orientation, 
c  may not  be  able to  overcome their numerical advantage. 
At  this  time,  c  may  change  its  orientation  to  match  theirs. 
Let us examine the emergence of social laws. We consider 
five agents a, b, c, d and e, which have the same social rank. 
If a and b have the same social strategy, sab, but the social 
strategies of the other three agents are quite different, then 
the  social  law  can  be  written  as  “all  agents  are  under 
pressure to follow strategy sab”. As time goes by, if c, d and 
e happen to establish the same social strategy, scde, the social 
law would change to “all agents are under pressure to follow 
strategy scde”. 

The  situation  becomes  more  complex  if  the  agents  do 
have explicit social rank. For this situation, we will need to 
balance  the  influence  of  rank  against  the  weight  of  sheer 
numbers.  Next  we  will  give  some  related  concepts  to 
explain the collective diffusion.  
2.2 Dominance of  Social Strategy 
If  a  social  strategy  is  accepted  by  many  agents,  its 
dominance  will  be  strong.  However,  different  agents  will 
contribute  different  amounts  to  the  dominance  of  a  social 
strategy.  A  superior  agent  strengthens  a  strategy’s 
dominance  far  more  than  a  junior  agent.  To  allow  for 
comparison, we equate the dominance of a social strategy to 
its rank. The concept of rank is used often in the web search 
field  to  denote  the  importance  of  web  pages  [Haveliwala, 
2003]. Now we use it to represent the relative dominance of 
social strategies. 

Definition 2.1 Social ranking of agent i can be a function: 
 i 
ip
has superior rank to j. The set of the positions of all agents 
n , 
in the system can be denoted as: 
p where

In  this  paper,  our  basic  idea  is:  if  agent  a  has  a  social 
strategy  s,  a is implicitly conferring some importance to  s. 
Then,  how  much  importance  does  an  agent  a  confer  to  its 
social strategy s? Let Na be the number of social strategies 
of a and pa represent the social rank of a, agent a confers pa 
/  Na units of rank to  s. As  for our instance, the number of 
social  strategies  of  an  agent  at  one  time  is  only  one, 
therefore, agent a confers pa units of rank to s.                                             
2.3 Overlay Group of  A Social Strategy 
The agents that share a social strategy are called the overlay 
group of th strategy. For example, in Figure 1 (b), agents b 
and d share social strategy 4 and so form one overlay group. 
Let G(s) represent the overlay group of social strategy s, we 
have:

u agent u accepts the social strategy s

Obviously, the rank of a social strategy is determined by 
its  overlay  group.  Let  G(s)  be  the  overlay  group  of  social 
strategy s, the rank of s can also be defined as: 

 

For example, the difference between social strategy 1 and 
7 is 2, and the difference between social strategy 3 and 4 is 
1.

The  impact  force  from  an  overlay  group  to  an  agent  is 
determined  both  by 
the  group’s 
dominance  (i.e.  the  dominance  of  the  corresponding  social 
strategy).  Therefore,  we  define  the  impact  force  from 
overlay group G to agent a as: 

their  distance  and

Where  f  is a  monotone increasing  function, 
2 are 
parameters to determine the relative importance of the two 
factors. From Equation (3.1), we can see that the nearer the 
agent is to the group and the higher the group’s rank is, then 
the great the impact force of the group is on that agent. 

1  and 

3.2 Counteracting  Force  from  Agent  to  Overlay 

Group 

Based  on  real-world  observations,  if  agent  a  is  not  a 
member  of  overlay  group  G,  a  will  instinctively  counter 
such  influence.  The  counteracting  force  from  agent  a  to 
overlay group G is determined by the following factors: 1) 
the social ranking of agent a, 2) the average social rank of 
overlay group G, 3) the distance of the social strategies (i.e. 
the  standing  orientations)  between  agent  a  and  overlay 
group G. The higher the social rank of agent a is, the bigger 
the difference  in  social strategies is, the lower the average 
social  rank  of  overlay  group  G  is,  then  the  more  agent  a 
resists  adopting  the  social  strategy  of  overlay  group  G. 
Therefore, if we let the social strategy of agent a be s1 and 
the  social  strategy  of  overlay  group  G  is  s2,  we  define  the 
counteracting force from agent a to overlay group G as:

As noted above, in our example agents can hold only one 
social strategy at any one time, and so can only contribute to 
the  dominance  of  only  one  social  strategy.  The  rank  of 
social strategy s can be simplified to: 

( )
Rank s

s

From Equations (2.2) (2.3), we can see that the rank of a 
social strategy is determined by the number and social ranks 
of the members of its overlay group.  

The diffusion strength of social strategy s is the monotone 
increasing function of its rank, i.e. the higher Rank(s) is, the 
higher the diffusion strength is. Let the diffusion strength of 
social strategy s be represented as S(s), we have:

To  simplify  the  question,  we  can  directly  use  the 
authority  of  a  social  strategy  s  to  represent  its  diffusion 
strength. Moreover, we will use the concept of group rank to 
represent the social strategy rank, i.e.

2.4 Distance between Agent and Overlay Group 
It  is  very  simple  to  compute  the  distance  between  two 
agents,  but  not  the  one  between  an  agent  and  a  group.  As 
stated  above,  each  agent  in  the  group  strengthens  the 
dominance  of  the  strategy  to  a  different  extent.  Therefore, 
we introduce the factor of social rank into the definition of 
the distance between an agent and a group as follows: 

Definition 2.2 If d(a,u) denote the distance between agent 
a and agent u, |G| denote the number of agents in group G, 
pu  denote  the  social  rank  of  agent  u,  then  the  distance 
between agent a and group G can be defined as:

3.4 Goal Function of Diffusion 
Several  social strategies  may  exist  even  after  the  diffusion 
process  reaches  equilibrium.  Simulating  actual  situations 
will  demand  that  we  set  different  goals  for  the  diffusion 
results.  

For  our  example  of  crowd  orientation,  we  may  want  to 
identify the conditions under which all agents finally adopt 
the same orientation. Moreover, the social laws are always 
established according to the more dominant social strategies. 
Obviously,  the  more  agent  numbers  the  dominant  social 
strategies are accepted by, the more rational the established 
social  laws  are.  Such  assumption  is  also  practical  in  real-
world  situations,  e.g.,  the  law  should  be  established  to 
satisfy the needs of most people in the society. 
 Therefore,  we  define 
the  performance  criterion  of 
diffusion as a measure of the winnowing of social strategies. 

 

Let NS be the number of social strategies in the system after 
diffusion, |
 be the agent number in the overlay group 
of  social  strategy  s,  then  the  performance  criterion  of  the 
diffusion can be defined as: 

( ) |G s

( ) |

( ) |)

(

s S

 

(3.4)                     

Higher  values  of  PS  indicate  that  fewer  social  strategies 
that  better  diffusion 

have  survived  and  also  show 
performance can be gotten.  

3.5 Diffusion Progress 
In  the  diffusion  progress,  the  social  strategy  with  the 
strongest dominance will firstly diffuse to other agents that 
belong to the other  social strategies’  overlay groups. After 
that, the social strategy with second strongest authority will 
diffuse to other agents that belong to the agents with more 
junior  authority  social  strategy,  ….,  until  there  are  no 
diffusions take place.  

Let  A  be  the  agent  set  of  the  system,  sa  be  the  social 
strategy of agent a, the diffusion progress can be shown as

model. Figure 2 is one such case. From the ranks of social 
strategies,  we  can  see  that  the  social  strategy  3  has  the 
 
strongest  dominance.  So  we  compute  the

This yields diffusion from G(3) to other agents according to 
Equation (3.3) and Algorithm 1, the progress of diffusion is

diffusion process is finished. The total number of diffusion 
steps is 3. 

From Figure 6, we can see that the standing orientations

steps  are  needed  to  reach  diffusion  termination  when 
and increase. Therefore, we should set  and  to match 

the actual situation being simulated.

5.  Discussion and Conclusion 
A  social  strategy  accepted  by  many  agents  will  have  high 
dominance and may diffuse to other agents. The dominance 
of a social strategy is determined by not only the number of 
adherents but also their social positions. That is, a superior 
agent  strengthens  the  dominance  of  a  social  strategy 
drastically,  while  the  addition  of  many  junior  agents  can 
also strengthen the dominance of a social strategy.  

This paper presents a collective strategy diffusion model 
in agent social law evolution. The model shows us that the 
social  strategy  of  a  superior  agent  may  be  changed  by  the 
social strategy shared by many agents, which is an example 
of  collective  insurgent  diffusion.  Section  4  showed  that  it 
was  possible  for  one  agent  of  quite  high  rank  to  retain  its 
social strategy even after all other agents have adopted the 
same social strategy, i.e. the counteracting force of the lone 
agent  overrides  the  collective  diffusion  force  of  all  other 
agents. Moreover, if we increase the social rank of the lone 
agent significantly, it is possible that its social strategy will 
diffuse to all other agents, which is an example of collective 
elite diffusion. 

We note that real world situations are often characterized 
by multiple strategies. For example, a commanding officer 
may  walk  among  his  troops  in  formation,  and  so  has  a 
completely different orientation to everyone else. The troops 
understand the situation and so unify their own orientation 
and do not blindly track the officer’s orientation. In another 
simple example, the commander has an absolute power and 
can  order  all  soldiers  to  follow  his  direction;  the  soldiers 
have to obey the order. 

Though  we  explained  our  formal  framework  using  the 
example  of  crowd  orientation,  it  offers  strong  generality. 
The  framework  and  algorithms  described  are  quite  general 
and can be applied in  many other cases simply by  making 
small adjustments. 

Our agent social strategy diffusion model is based on the 
diffusion of strategy from collective agents to one agent step 
by  step.  This  involves  significant  time  costs  when  the 
number  of agents  is large. Such a diffusion  model  may be 
practical in some real-world situations, however, which are 
not fully representative of reality as a whole. In real-world 
situations,  there  are  many  concurrent  diffusion  movements 
between  groups.  Therefore,  in  our  future  works,  we  will 

 

explore  the  concurrent  diffusion  from  collective  agents  to 
collective agents.
