Summary 

E-Resolution  may  be  compared  to  other  methods 
f or  handling  equality  substitutions 
in  Resolution, 
namely,  Demodulation, 10 Paramodulation,  and  the 
system  described  by  Sibert.9 

The  Demodulation  system  is 

the  forerunner  of 

the  basic 

inspired  by 

the  more  general,  more  powerful  Paramodulation 
system. 
In  the  generating  of  equality  trees  by 
ETG,  a  p o r t i on  of  the  technique  used  is  very
