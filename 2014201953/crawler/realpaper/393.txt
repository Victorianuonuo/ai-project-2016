Very  few  native  speakers  would  i n t u it 
that  [5a]  is  grammatical,  yet  to  prevent 
i ts  generation,  either  the  grammar  must 
be  greatly  complicated  or  other  sentences 
which  native  speakers  do  accept  must  be 
marked  ungrammatical.  Linguists  resolve 
this  dilemma  and  preserve  the  simplicity 
and  generality  of  their  grammars  by  claim(cid:173)
ing  that  native  English  speakers  do  have 
the  basic  knowledge  to  process  [5a], 
which  is  therefore  grammatical;  speakers 
have  trouble  with  it  because  their  per(cid:173)
ceptual  mechanisms  do  not  provide  the 
memory  space  and/or  computational  rou(cid:173)
tines  required  to  process  i t.  A  trans(cid:173)
formational  grammar  is  a  formal  specifi-

cation  of  the  speaker's  competence  and  has 
nothing  to  say  about  psychological  func(cid:173)
tioning. 

Despite  these  disclaimers,  psycho(cid:173)
linguists  have  been  intrigued  by  trans(cid:173)
formational  theory  because  it  provides 
the  most  intricate  and  compelling  expli(cid:173)
cation  to  date  of  a  large  number  of  basic 
linguistic  i n t u i t i o n s.  Many  experiments 
have  been  conducted  to  test  the  hypothesis 
that  transformational  operations  w i ll  have 
direct,  observable  reflexes  in  psycholo(cid:173)
gical  processing;  Fodor  and  Garrett  (8) 
and  Bever  (1)  present  useful  reviews  of 
this  l i t e r a t u r e.  A  major  concern  of  these 
studies  has  been  to  determine  whether  the 
perceptual  complexity  of  sentences  (the 
d i f f i c u l ty  of  comprehending  and  respon(cid:173)
ding  to  them)  is  directly  correlated 
with  derivational  complexity  (e.g.,  the 
number  of  transformations  required  to 
generate  them).  Fodor  and  Garrett  (8) 
examine  this  "derivational  theory  of 
complexity"  in  detail  and  conclude  that 
the  available  psycholinguistic  data  do 
not  offer  much  support  for  it  and  that 
the  connection,  if  there  is  one,  between 
transformational  grammar  and  perception 
is  not  very  direct  at  a l l. 

Although  psycholinguists  have  v i r(cid:173)
tually  abandoned  their  attempts  to  find 
perceptual  reflexes  of  specific  grammati(cid:173)
cal  features,  several  studies  have  been 
successful  in  corroborating  the  psycho(cid:173)
logical  reality  of  the  deep  structure-
surface  structure  d i s t i n c t i o n.  MacKay 
and  Bever  (15)  found  that  subjects  respond 
differently  to  deep  structure  and  surface 
structure  ambiguities;  Wanner  (25)  showed 
that  the  number  of  deep  structure  S-nodes 
underlying  a  sentence  has  a  direct  i n f l u(cid:173)
ence  on  the  ease  of  prompted  recall  from 
long-term  memory;  and  Bever  (1)  has  rein(cid:173)
terpreted  the  results  of  the  click  exper(cid:173)
iments  (7)  as  demonstrating  that  deep-
structure  S-nodes  affect  the  surface  seg(cid:173)
mentation  of  a  stimulus  sentence.  These 
experiments  suggest  that  an  adequate  model 
of  sentence  comprehension  must  incorporate 
some  mechanism  for  recovering  a  deep-
structure-like  representation  of  a  given 
stimulus  word  string.  This  representation 
should  e x p l i c i t ly  denote  at  least  such 
basic  grammatical  relationships  as  actor, 
verb,  and  object.  More  extensive  empiri(cid:173)
cal  work  should  indicate  whether  deep 
structure  must  be  even  more  abstract  than 
t h i s. 

There  are  several  other  requirements 
for  adequacy  that  we  may  impose  on  poten(cid:173)
t i al  models  of  sentence  comprehension, 
based  on  some  common  observations  about 

Session No.  10 Computer Understanding  I (Communication)

our  sentence  processing  a b i l i t i e s: 
(a)  A  perceptual  model  must  process 

strings  in  essentially  temporal  or 
linear  order,  for  this  is  the  order 
in  which  sentences  are  encountered 
in  conversation  and  reading. 

(b)  It  must  process  strings  and  provide 
appropriate  analyses  in  an  amount  of 
time  proportional  to  that  required 
by  human  speakers.  For  example, 
since  perceptual  d i f f i c u l ty  does 
not  rapidly  increase  as  the  length 
of  the  sentence  increases,  the  amount 
of  time  required  by  the  model  should 
be  at  most  a  slowly  increasing 
function  of  sentence  length.

In  order  to  be  able  to  refer  to  the 

current  input  symbol  in  conditions  or 
actions,  a  special  register,  named  *, 
has  been  provided.  More  properly,  this 
register  always  contains  the  constituent 
that  enabled  the  transition;  usually 
this  is  the  input  symbol,  but  for 
actions  on  a  push  arc  (which  are  usually 
executed  after  the  return  from  the  lower 
level),  *  contains  the  structural  des(cid:173)
cription  of  the  phrase  identified  In  the 
lower  computation.  This  phrase  is  de(cid:173)
termined  when  a  special  type  of  arc,  a 
pop  arc,  is  taken  from  a  f i n al  state  at 
the  lower  level  ( f i n al  states  are  dis(cid:173)
tinguished  by  the  existence  of  pop  arcs). 

The  recursive  transition  network, 
with  a ll  of  these  additions,  Is  called 
an  augmented  recursive  transition  net(cid:173)
work;  it  is  easy  to  show  that  it  has 
the  generative  power  of  a  Turing  machine. 
To  demonstrate  more  concretely  how  the 
transition  network  works,  we  give  a  sim(cid:173)
ple  example.  Figure  1  shows  a  transition 
network  grammar  that  w i ll  recover  deep 
structures  for  simple  transitive  and  i n(cid:173)
transitive  sentences,  such  as  [6]  and 
[ 7 ]: 

[6]  The  man  kicked  the  b a l l. 

[7]  The  ball  f e l l. 

The  top  of  the  figure  shows  the  organi(cid:173)
zation  of  paths  in  the  network.  States 
are  represented  by  circles  with  the 
state  name  inside.  The  state-names  are 
purely  mnemonic,  serving  to  indicate  the 
constituent  being  analyzed  (to  the  l e ft 
of  the  slash)  and  how  much  of  that  con(cid:173)
stituent  has  been  identified  so  far. 
Each  arc  specifies  what  w i ll  allow  the 
transition  and  has  a  number  denoting 
the  condition  and  actions  in  the  table 
below.  We  mentioned  above  three  kinds 
of  arcs:  ordinary  input  symbol  arcs, 
push  arcs,  and  pop  arcs.  To  distinguish 
these  arcs  from  each  other  and  from 
other  arc  types,  each  arc  has  an  explicit 
type-indicator.  Thus,  PUSH  NP/  specifies 
that  arc  1  is  a  push  arc  and  that  control 
is  to  pass  to  state  NP/.  POP  (SBUILD) 
indicates  that  arc  5  Is  a  pop  arc,  and 
the  structure  to  be  popped  (that  i s, 
placed  in  *  at  the  next  higher  level) 
is  the  value  of  the  function  SBUILD. 
Figure  1  includes  two  new  types:  a  CAT 
arc  (arc  2)  does  not  require  a  specific 
input  symbol,  but  requires  that  the  word 
be  marked  in  the  dictionary  as  belonging 
to  the  specified  lexical  category.  A 
JUMP  arc  (arc  4)  is  a  very  special  arc 
that  allows  a  transition  in  the  grammar,

Let  us  trace  the  analysis  of  sentence 

[6]  using  this  grammar  (Figure  3  shows 
the  trace  as  it  is  printed  out  by  the 
program).  The  starting  state  i s,  by 
convention,  the  state  labelled  S/.  The 
only  arc  leaving  S/  is  a  push  for  a 
noun-phrase,  so  without  advancing  the 
input  string,  we  switch  to  NP/.  Since 
the,  the  current  input  symbol,  is  in 
the  category  DET  and  since  the  condition 
for  arc  6  is  t r i v i a l ly  true,  we  can  take 
arc  6,  executing  the  action  (SETR  DET  *). 
SETR  is  a  primitive  action  that  places 
the  structure  specified  by  i ts  second 
argument  (in  this  case,  the  current  input 
word,  denoted  by  *)  in  the  register  named 
by  i ts  f i r st  argument  (DET).  Thus  after 
following  arc  6,  the  register  DET  contains 
the,  and  we  continue  processing  at  state 
NP/DET,  looking  at  the  word  man.  We  are 
permitted  to  take  arc  7,  saving  man  in 
the  register  N,  and  arrive  at  the  f i n al 
state  NP/N.  We  take  the  POP  arc,  which 
defines  the  phrase  to  be  returned. 
BUILDQ  Is  a  primitive  action  that  takes 
as  i ts  f i r st  argument  a  tree  fragment 
with  some  nodes  denoted  by  the  symbol  +. 
These  nodes  are  replaced  by  the  contents 
of  the  registers  specified  as  the  remain(cid:173)
ing  arguments,  in  l e f t - t o - r i g ht  order. 
Thus  the  value  returned  by  arc  8  w i ll  be

provide  only  one  analysis;  the  other 
analyses  are  obtained  by  simulating 
blocked  paths  after  successes. 

A.  The  Relations  Between  Clauses 

Since  sentences  are  frequently  com(cid:173)

posed  of  more  than  one  clause,  the  native 
speaker  must  have  a  strategy  for  deci(cid:173)
ding  how  the  component  clauses  of  a  sen(cid:173)
tence  are  related  to  each  other  ( e . g ., 
which  is  the  main  clause,  which  are  re(cid:173)
lative  clauses,  and  which  are  subordi(cid:173)
nate).  Bever  propounds  that  "the  f i r st 
N..V..(N)  clause... 
is  the  main  clause, 
unless  the  verb  is  marked  as  subordinate" 
( 1,  Strategy  B,  p.  294),  and  points  out 
that  a  sentence  is  perceptually  more 
complicated  whenever  the  f i r st  verb  is 
not  the  main  verb,  even  if  it  is  marked 
as  subordinate.3  Thus,  sentences  with 
preposed  subordinate  clauses  [12b]  are, 
according  to  this  hypothesis,  relatively 
more  d i f f i c u lt  than  their  normally  or(cid:173)
dered  counterparts  [12a]: 

[12]  a.  The  dog  bit  the  cat  because 

the  food  was  gone. 

b.  Because  the  food  was  gone, 

the  dog  bit  the  cat. 
[2^a-b]). 
(=Dever's 

And  in  cases  where  the  verb  is  sub(cid:173)
ordinate  but  not  marked  as  such,  this 
strategy  can  lead  to  serious  perceptual 
errors.  Bever  reports  that  subjects  had 
much  more  d i f f i c u l ty  understanding  sen(cid:173)
tences  l i ke  [13a],  where  there  is  an 
illusory  main  verb  and  sentence  (under(cid:173)
lined),  than  [13b],  even  though  both 
sentences,  being  center-embedded,  are 
exceedingly  d i f f i c u l t: 

[13]  a.  The  editor  authors  the 
newspaper  hired  liked

b.  The  editor  the  authors  the

relative  clause  grammar,  the  noun  phrase

not  counting  the  blocked  R/NIL  arcs  in

( s e(cid:173)

We  have  thus  expanded  our  simple  gram(cid:173)
mar  to  accept  and  provide  deep  structures 
for  a  variety  of  constructions.  Our  gram(cid:173)
mar  has  the  same  formal  power  to  describe 
these  structures  as  a  transformational 
grammar,  but  we  have  been  able  to  arrange 
the  analysis  path  so  that  complexity  in 
our  model  corresponds  to  perceptual  com(cid:173)
plexity,  as  stated  by  Bever's  Strategy  B. 
We  have  taken  advantage  of  the  fact  that, 
unlike  the  ordering  of  transformations, 
the  order  of  arcs  can  be  freely  changed, 
radically  altering  the  amount  of  computa(cid:173)
tion  required  for  particular  sentences, 
without  affecting  the  class  of  acceptable 
sentences. 

B.  Functional  Labels 

A  major  task  in  sentence  comprehen(cid:173)

sion  is  the  determination  of  the  function(cid:173)
al  relationships  of  constituents  within 
a  single  clause,  of  deciding  who  the  sub(cid:173)
ject  i s,  what  the  action  I s,  etc.  Bever 
suggests  a  simple  strategy  for  assigning 
functional  labels  based  on  the  l e f t - t o-
right  surface  order  of  constituents:  "Any 
Noun-Verb-Noun  (NVN)  sequence  within  a  po(cid:173)
t e n t i al  internal  [deep  structure]  unit  in 
the  surface  structure  corresponds  to  'ac(cid:173)
tor-action-object '"  ( 1,  Strategy  D,  p.298). 
Bever  cites  several  perceptual  studies 
involving  sentences  for  which  this  stra(cid:173)
