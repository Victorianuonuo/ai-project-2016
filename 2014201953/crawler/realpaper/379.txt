Introduction 

In  this  paper  the  problem  of  pat­
tern  recognition  is  considered  as  that 
of  determining  a  method  for  predicting 
future  empirical  results  based  on  i n­
vestigation  of  only  preliminary  i n f o r­
mation  of  an  object  and  phenomena  which 
are  in  previous  experiments  ( in  t r a i­
ning  samle).  Solution  of  the  problem 
stated,  in  p r i n c i p l e,  depends  on  the 
acceptance  of  a  n a t u r a l - s c i e n t i f ic  hy­
pothesis  that  already  has  been  mentioned 
in  the  l i t e r a t u re  (1).  We  assume  that 
such  a  n a t u r a l - s c i e n t i f ic  hypothesis, 
in  appropriate  way,  must  explain  the 
h i s t o r i c al  fact  that  mathematically 
simpler  natural-scientific  theories,  as 
a  r u l e,  are  more  preferable  as  methods 
of  predicting  future  experimental  facts. 
The  concern  of  this  paper  is  how  one 
can  use  the  conception  of  simplicity  f o­
rmulated  only  on  i n t u i t i ve  level  for

}  and  empirical 
operations  F= 
relations  P= j p1... , pa  }  on  a  set  of  sta­
ndards.  Relative  to  these  operations  and 
relations  the  measuring  object  must  be­
have  in  the  same  way  as  one  of  the  stan­
dards.  Let  us  introduce  the  following 
d e f i n i t i o n:  the  feature  {xj  is  a  class 
of  a ll  algebraic  systems  isomorphic  to 
that  X=<X;  F;  P > in  which  domain  X 
is 
a  set  of  standards,  F  and  P  are  c o l­
lection  of  empirical  operations  and  r e­
lations  on  this  set,  correpondingly. 

For  example,  the  feature  "weight" 
is  a  class  of  a ll  algebraic  systems  iso­
>,  where  W 
morphic to that  <W;  (+)  ; 
is  an  accounting  set  of  standards  (wei­
is  that  of  obtain­
ghts),  operation  © 
ing  any  standard  by  putting  together  on 
a  pan  two  different  standards,  relation 

is  "not  heavier  than"  (3). 

Since  an  abstract  class  of  algebra­
ic  system  is  quite  characterized  by  any 
of  i ts  representatives 
Including  a  sys­
tem  in  which  the  domain  is  a  set  of  num­
bers,  operations  and  relations  -  suita­
ble  numerical  operations  and  relations, 
then  one  can  describe,  f or  instance,  the 
feature  "weight"  as  a  class  of  a ll  alge­
braic  systems  isomorphic  to  a  numerical 
one  (N;  +  ;  ≤>
