which  includes  a  cube  and  a  plane  covered  by 
two  different  patterns.  We  intend  to  describe 
more  complex  scenes  having  much  information  in 
terms  of  regions  in  which  some  picture  pro­
perties  are  regarded  as  uniform.  S t a t i s t i­
cal  methods  for  finding  the  abrupt  changes 
in  the  average  gray  levels  seem  to  be  inade­
quate  for  our  purpose,  because  these  ap­
proaches  are  not  useful  to  distinguish  dif­
ferences  between  patterns  of  complex  struc­
tures.  Thus  a  structural  analysis  on  homo­
geneities  of  several  picture  properties  such 
as  shapes  or  sizes  of  atomic  regions  in  the 
input  picture,  as  well  as  their  relations, 
is  used  to  find  the  regions. 

Picture  Properties 

Before  descibing  the  procedures  for  exam­

ining  the  uniformity  in  the  region,  we  must 
c l a r i fy  what  picture  properties  are  used  for 
the  analysis. 
In  this  paper,  the  atomic  re­
gion  is  defined  as  a  connected  set  of  pic­
ture  elements  having  almost  same  gray  level 
or  color.  A  preprocessor  of  the  system  finds 
these  atomic  regions  in  the  digitized  pic­
ture  from  a  TV  camera,  and  sends  to  the  homo­
geneity  analyzer  the  information  of  these 
atomic  regions  characterized  by  their  average 
gray  levels  and  colors,  as  well  as  their 
boundaries  written  in  chain  coding. 
are  many  atomic  regions  in  an  input  picture, 
therefore  an  efficient  representation  of 
their  characteristics  is  needed  in  order  to 
save  memory  space  and  computing  time.  Sev­
eral  picture  descriptors  of  the  atomic  re­
gion  are  selected.  They  are  shape,  size, 
position,  color  and  average  gray  level  de­
scriptors,  although  last  two  are  not  used 
in  the  partitioning  process.  Area  and  per­
imeter  of  each  atomic  region  are  specified 
by  the  size  descriptor,  and  the  position  de­
scriptor  gives  the  two  dimensional  cordinate 
at  the  center  of  gravity  of  the  atomic  re­
gion. 

There 

Because  of  the  limitaion  in  the  resolu­

 

and 

M2l* 

M12 

Ma?' 

tion  of  the  TV  camera,  accurate  shape  of  the 
atomic  region  is  not  available,  and  the 
shape  descriptor  must  be  selected  in  such  a 
way  that  it  gives  coarse  information  of  the 
shape  and  it  is  not  sensitive  to  sampling 
noises  in  the  process  of  d i g i t i z i ng  picture. 
A  set  of  i j th  order  moment  M.  .  seems  to  sat-
t i s fy  these  conditions.  A  combination  of 
M

shape  descriptor,  since  a  series  of  experi­
ments  shows  that  it  is  adequate  for  detect­
ing  shape  differences  of  small  size  domains. 
Another  type  of  picture  properties  used 

M11  is  adopted  as  the 

for  the  analysis  is  relation  between  two 
atomic  regions  or  regions.  For  simplicity, 
only  the  density  descriptors  are  used  for  re­
presenting  the  relation  between  atomic  re­
gions  in  a  group.  Let  define  the  distance 
between  two  atomic  regions  as  the  distance 
between  their  centers  of  gravity.  An  atomic 
region  A  in  a  given  set  S  has  a  density  de­
scriptor  D  whose  value  is  the  minimum  dis­
tance  frorn8  A  to  other  atomic  regions  in  S. 

Regions 

Examining  the  s i m i l a r i t i es  of  the  pic­
ture  properties  by  comparing  the  values  of 
these  descriptors,  the  system  w i ll  classify 
the  atomic  regions  into  sets  S1,  S2,...,  Sn 

565 

which  are  candidates  for  the  regions.  The  re­
gion  R  covered  by  m  elements  in  the  set  S  is 
defined  as  follows.  Let  denote  the  maximum 
value  of  the  density  descriptors  in  s  by  Ls  . 
ft is  a  connected  area  covered  by  squares 
whose  length  of  edge  is  Ls  and  centers  are 
located  at  centers  of  gravity  of  a ll  members 
of  S  (  Fig.2  ).  Sometimes  there  are  p l u r al 
regions  whose  elements  belong  to  one  set  s. 

The  analyzer  also  examines  a  relation  be­
tween  regions.  Fig.3  shows  a  simple  example 
in  which  there  exist  two  classes  of  atomic 
regions.  Let  R1,  and  R2  be  regions  covered 
by  small  dots  and  large  dots.respectively., 
Since  common  area  of 
/?  of  two  regions 
has  considerable  size,  it  seems  reasonable 
for  the  analyzer  to  regard  these  areas  as 
■three  regions  R1  \  *2>  R}  O  ffg  and  R1  O  R2 
instead  of  two. 

fljf\ 

Therefore  the  system  checks  whether  each 

region  has  any  overlapped  part  or  not,  but 
neglect  ones  whose  size  is  less  than  a  cer­
tain  threshold  value. 

Structural  Analysis

Fig.4  shows  an  overall  diagram  of  the 
scene  analyzer.  Output  of  a  standard  v i d i-
con  camera  is  transmitted  to  an  analog  to 
d i g i t al  converter  which  produces  one  of 
64x64,  128x128  or  256X256  digitized  pic­
tures  with  64  gray  levels.  A  preprocessor 
searches  in  the  digitized  picture  for  the 
atomic  regions.  We  consider  that  color 
information  is  more  useful  to  our  purpose, 
however  only  gray  level  information  is  used 
in  the  experiments. 
In  this  paper,  an  as­
sumption  is  made  that  each  atomic  region 
has  a  clear  outline.  Thus  we  put  l i t t le 
emphasis  on  the  process  of  finding  the  atomic
