The  problem  of  segmentation,  breaking  a  complex

are  of  wider  a p p l i c a b i l i t y.  The  main  idea 
is  to  apply

follows:  given  a  picture  of  some  scene,  we  have  a 
rectangle  composed  of  some  "00  x  300  points  and 
for 
each  such  point  some  information  on  the  l i g ht  i n(cid:173)

ing  60000  points  is  far  too  many,  so,  depending  on  the 
perception  task  that  we  have  in  mind, 
the  image  should 
be  segmented  into  regions.  Each  of  these  regions 
should  be  meaningful  in  the  problem  domain  and  the 
relevant  information  needed 
should  be  easily  obtainable.

over  a ll  partitions  of  the  image  into  regions  and 
assignments  of  labels  to  regions.  This  is  quite 
conventional  so  far  and  i s,  in  fact,  too  simple  for 
our  purposes.  We  want  to  account  for  two  additional 
considerations.  First we must  use  the  model  to  get  a 
good  segmentation  of  the  image  into  regions.  For 
example,  we  might  want  to  merge  green,  yellow  and 
brown  patches  to  create  the  whole  area  that  we  call 
grass.  Secondly,  we  want  to  use  additional  semantic 
constraints  e.g.  the  grass  is  below  the  sky,  to  i n(cid:173)
fluence  the  total  probability  of  an  analysis  of  the 
scene. 

In  an  attempt  to  enrich  the  semantic  structure  to 

support  more  of  the  problem  knowledge  and  to  provide 
for  control  mechanism  on  the  region  growing  algorithm, 
the  semantic  structure  was  allowed  to  have  also  " f i r st

each  individual  region  wc  have,  for  each  pair  of  ad(cid:173)
jacent  regions  of  some  interpretations,  expected 
relative  properties  and  some  expected  features  of  their 
common  boundary  line.  For  instance  if  we  have  two 
adjacent  regions,  one  which  is  named  "sky"  and  the 
other  " h i l l"  then  we  expect  that  the  sky  is  above  the 
h i l l,  is  a  brighter  blue  than  the  h i l l s,  and  that  the 
boundary  is  usually  a  more  or  less  horizontal  smooth 
l i n e.  The  relative  properties  are  usually  more  signi(cid:173)
ficant  than  the  absolute  properties  since  they  are 
less  sensitive  to  variation  between  pictures.  This 
semantic  model  is  too  limited  to  describe  a ll  that  is 
known  of  a  scene,  but  many  classes  of  scenes  can  be 
Segmented  properly  with  f i r st  order  methods. 

Recall  that  we  want  to  get  a  partition  of  the  i n(cid:173)
put  and  interpretation  for  the  segments  (regions)  and 
boundaries  so  as  to  maximize  the  likelihood  of  having 
the  right  interpretation.  Let  R(i)  be  the  i-th  region, 
B ( i , j)  the  boundary  between  region  R(i)  and  R(j)  ( if 
it  exists)  and  the  label  of  R(i)  be  INT(i).  Then  with 
our  f i r st  order  assumption  the  expression  that  we  want 
to  maximize  i s:

It  also  entails 
an  assumption  that  the  probability  can  be  factored  i n(cid:173)

similar  argument  can  be  Used  for  the  factorization  of

For  a  given  u t i l i ty  function  (like  [11)  there  are 

standard  techniques  in  decision  theory  for  finding  the 
maximum  u t i l i t y.  Unfortunately,  the  general  techniques 
are  too  slow  and  much  of  our  effort  has  gone  into  de(cid:173)
veloping  algorithms  for  efficiently  computing  an  ap(cid:173)
proximately  optimal  partition.  The  region  growing  a l(cid:173)
gorithm  starts  with  many  small  regions  and  on  each 
iteration  merges  two  adjacent  regions  (regions  with  a 
common  boundary).  The  two  basic  decisions  are  which 
pair  of  regions  to  merge  on  each  iteration  and  when  to 
stop  the  algorithm.  These  two  decisions  can  be  con(cid:173)
trolled  directly  by  the  limited  probabilistic  semantic 
world  model  that  we  have-

Hence  the  control  of  the  region  growing  algorithm  is  by 
evaluation  of  the  boundary  strength.  We  w i ll  show  how 
our  semantic  representation  can  be  used  directly  to 
compute  the  goundary  strenth. 

The  second  task  of  the  semantics  is  to  produce  the 

stopping  criterion  for  the  region  grower.

on  local  measurements  of  the  region)  between  the  most

boundary  between  two  regions  of  known  i n t e r p r e t a t i on 
has  to  be  counted  in  as  a  boundary  between  those  two 
interpretations.  We  relax  this  condition  by  hreaking 
the  product  ( l)

each  sub-product  separately,  and,  multiplying  them, 
obtain  in  an  upper  bound  on  the  value  of  the  best

It  is  this  sort  of  estimate  which  would  be

LEARNING
