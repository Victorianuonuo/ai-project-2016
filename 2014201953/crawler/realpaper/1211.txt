The  interest  in  using  a  base  of  Haarfs

Some  of  the  analyzed  patterns  are  r e(cid:173)

The  extraction  of  the  main  features 
of  a  monodimensional  geometric  pattern  by  pro(cid:173)
j e c t i on  on  a  Haar  orthonormal  base  is  then  a  pro-
ceedure  that  permits  a  very  small  information 
loss.  In  t h is  way  we  can  make  the  comparisons 
between  structures,  on  one  hand  by  considering 
the  number  of  d i s c o n t i n u i t i es  brought  out  at  the 
order  where  one  has  stopped  and  on  the  other 
hand  by  considering  the  value  of  the  c o e f f i c i e n t s. 
For  example, 
the  patterns  of  figure  4.  are  very 
close  to  each  other  and  have  j u st  two  d i s c o n t i(cid:173)
n u i t i e s, 
they  are  symetrical  in  r e l a t i on  to  the 
middle  of  the  i n t e r v al  ( 0 . 1 ).  These  properties 
appear  in  the  values  of  the  coefficients  which 
are  symetrical  in  r e l a t i on  to  0.5. 

If  the  patterns  to  be  analyzed  have 
the  noiseless  character  of  figure  3.  but 

not 
they  are  deformed,  f or  example,  by  the  presence 
of  noise,  the  analysis  w i ll  remain  v a l i d.  As  we 
can  see  in  figures  6,  8  and  9  the  nuls  c o e f f i(cid:173)
cients  are  no  longer  nuls,  but  c e r t a in  of  the 
most  characteristic  amongst  them  stand  out  clear(cid:173)
ly  from  the  background  noise  of  the  others.  The 
pattern  signal  to  noise  level  is  roughly  17  dB. 

5  -  CONCLUSION 

The  c l a s s i f i c a t i on  of  a  set  of  patterns 

by  the  projection  on  a  t o t al  base  of  orthonormal 
functions  permits  to  summarize  the  patterns  in 
an  e f f i c i e nt  manner  ;  on  the  condition  of  choo(cid:173)

patterns  which  concern  the  c l a s s i f i c a t i o n.
