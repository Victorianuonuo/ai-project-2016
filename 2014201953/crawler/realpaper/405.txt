are  a  sample.  Hence  choice  of  an  evalua(cid:173)
tion  measure  for  grammars  amounts  to  de(cid:173)
ciding  which  generalizations  about  lan(cid:173)
guage  are  significant. 

The  class  of  possible  hypotheses  must 
be  limited,  if  a  realistic  theory  of  syn 
tax  acquisition  is  to  be  developed.  How(cid:173)
ever,  the  limitation  must  s t i ll  yield  a 
class  of  grammars  that  is  adequate  in 
strong  (and  a_  fort i o ri  weak)  generative 
capacity.  But  beyond  this,  the  require(cid:173)
ment  of  feasibility  is  the  major 
con(cid:173)
straint  of  the  model. 

I  shall  have  very  few  words  to  add  to 

Chomsky's  formulation  of  the  problem, 
mainly  for  carrying  further  the  formali(cid:173)
zation.  My  concern  was  for  (1)  delimiting 
a  class  of  grammars  which  proved  adequate 
in  strong  generative  capacity,  and  defin 
ing  a  strategy  for  (2)  reduction  of  pos(cid:173)
sible  hypotheses,  and  for  (3)  selecting 
a  unique  grammar.  There  is  some  similari 
ty  between  the  grammars  that  we  are  going 
to  describe,  and  Bar-Hillel's  (4 )  catego 
r i al  grammars. 

A  model  similar  to  the  one  that  we 

shall  describe  -  although  of  reduced  sco 
pe  -  proved  its  feasibility  on  the  compu 
ter  (5)(6) .

production  A ->[_u_] ,  where  "["  and  "]'  are 
not  in  V.  Note  that  "renaming  produc(cid:173)

and  a  negative  sample  M  ={  n , n , . . . ,n  }

model  at  the  discrete  time  t.  At  each  time 
t  we  are  interested  in  observing  the  gram

In  other  words,  identification  in  the 
limit  implies  that  there  are  primary  data 
ST  ,  MT,  t > t ',  which  cause  the  model  to  se 
— 
lect  a  grammar  which  is  not  later  changed 
and  is  strongly  equivaJcnt  to  the  source 
grammar.  This  must  be  true  for  any  infor(cid:173)
mation  sequences  for  that  source  grammar. 

Two  results,  due  to  Gold  (7),  should 

be mentioned. 
Theorem  1  -  Let  C  be  a  class  of  decidable 

grammars  (i.e.  grammars  for 

which  it  is  decidable  whether  a  string  is 
generated  by  the  grammar).  Then,  if  GS  is 
in  C  there  is  an  algorithm  which  identi(cid:173)
fies  GS  in  the  limit. 
Theorem  2  -  Let  C  be  a  class  of  grammars 
which  generam  all  the  finite 
languages  and  any  one  infinite  language. 
Assume  the  primary  data  consist  only  of  a 
positive  information  sequence.  Then,  if 
GS is  in  C  there  exists  no  algorithm  for 
the  class  C  which  is  able  to  identifv  GS 5 
in  the  limit, 

As  a  special  case  of  Theorem  1,  context 

free  languages  are  identifiable  in  the  li 
mit ,  if  sentences  and  non-sentences  (iden 
tified  as  such)  are  given.  If  the  latter 
are  not  available,  Theorem  ?  implies  that 
not  even  finite  state  languages  can  be 
identified  in  the  limit. 

We  note  that  the  proof  of  the  f i r st 

theorem  is  based  on  the  fact  that  grammars 
are  enumerable,  and  on  the  possibility  of 
testing  1)  and  2)  for  a  decidable  grammar. 
Such  a  proof  does  not  lend  itself  to  a 
feasible  grammar  acquisition  method  for
