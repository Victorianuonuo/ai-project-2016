generalization 

Analogy  is  a  powerful  boundary-transcending  process 
that  exploits  a  conceptual  system’s  ability  to  perform 
controlled 
and 
re-specialization into another. The result of this semantic 
leap is the transference of meaning from one concept to 
another from which metaphor derives its name (literally: 
to carry over). Such generalization and re-specialization 
can  be  achieved  using  a  variety  of  representations  and 
techniques,  most  notably  abstraction  via  a  taxonomic 
backbone,  or  selective  projection  via  structure-mapping 
on  propositional  content.  In  this  paper  we  explore  the 
extent to which a bilingual lexical ontology for English 
and  Chinese,  called  HowNet,  can  support  both  ap-
proaches to analogy.

Introduction

1
Theories of analogy and metaphor are typically based either 
on structure-mapping (e.g., [Falkenhainer et al.1989; Veale 
and Keane, 1997]) or on abstraction e.g., [Hutton, 1982; Fass, 
1988;  Way,  1991;  Veale,  2003).  While  the  former is  most 
associated with analogy, the latter has been a near-constant in 
the computational treatment of metaphor. Structure-mapping 
assumes that the causal behaviour of a concept is expressed 
in  an  explicit,  graph-theoretic  form  so  that  unifying 
sub-graph  isomorphisms  can  be  found  between  different 
propositional representations.  In  contrast,  abstraction theo-
ries assume that analogous concepts, even if far removed in 
ontological  terms,  will  nonetheless  share  a  common  hy-
pernym  that  will  capture  their  causal  similarity.  Thus,  we 
should expect an analogous pairing like cancer and assassin
to have very different immediate hypernyms but to ultimately 
share  a  behavioural  abstraction  like  kill-agent (e.g.,  see 
[Veale, 2003]).

With  a  well  known  lexical  ontology  like  WordNet  (see 
[Miller, 1995]), both structure-mapping and taxonomic ap-
proaches  are  problematic.  The  idea  that  a  one-size-fits-all 
representation  like  WordNet  will  actually  provide  a  hy-
pernym like kill-agent seems convenient almost to the point 
of  incredulity.  As  much  as  we  want  our  ontologies  to  an-

ticipate future analogies with these pro-active categorizations, 
most  off-the-shelf  ontologies  simply  do  not  possess  such 
convenient  terms  (see  [Wong,  2004].  Similarly,  WordNet 
lacks the propositional content that is the necessary grist for a 
structure-mapping  approach.  The  semantic  content  that 
would ideally fill this role is not explicit, but implicitly re-
sides in the unstructured textual glosses that annotate each 
lexical concept. 

In this paper we explore whether another lexical ontology, 
the  Chinese/English  HowNet  system  (see  [Dong,  1988; 
Carpuat  et  al. 2002;  Wong,  2004]),  is  better  suited to  the 
demands of analogy generation. HowNet combines a taxo-
nomic  backbone  with  an  explicit,  if  somewhat  sparse  and 
under-specified,  propositional  semantics. This  combination 
allows  us  to  evaluate  the  extent  to  which  both  struc-
ture-mapping  and  abstraction theories  of  analogy  can  be 
supported by the same lexical ontology.

2 Past Work
That analogy and metaphor operate across multiple levels of 
conceptual abstraction has been well known since classical 
times.  Aristotle  first  provided  a  compelling taxonomic  ac-
count of both in his Poetics (see [Hutton, 1982] for a trans-
lation), and computationalists have been fascinated by this 
perspective  ever  since.  While  the  core  idea  has  survived 
relatively  unchanged,  one  must  discriminate  theories  that 
apparently presume a static type-hierarchy to be sufficient for 
all  abstraction  purposes  (e.g.,  [Fass,  1998]),  from  theories 
that posit the need for a dynamic type hierarchy (e.g., [Way, 
1991; Veale, 2003]). One must also differentiate theories that 
have  actually  been  implemented  (e.g.,  [Fass,  1988;  Veale, 
2003,2004]) from those that are either notional or that seem 
to  court  computational  intractability  (e.g.,  [Hutton,  1982; 
Way, 1991]). Perhaps most meaningfully, one must differ-
entiate 
assume 
hand-crafted,  purpose-built  ontologies  (e.g.,  [Fass,  1988]) 
from those that exploit an existing large-scale resource like 
WordNet  (e.g.,  [Veale,  2003,2004]).  The  latter  approach 
side-steps any possible charge of hand-crafting by working 
only with third-party resources, but at the cost of living with 
their perceived flaws and inadequacies. 

implementations 

Structure-Mapping theory is founded on the premise that 
the  most  satisfying  analogies  are  those  that  operate  at  the 

theories 

that 

and 

causal  level  of  representation,  since  causality  allows an 
analogy to offer a deep explanation for a poorly understood 
phenomenon (e.g., see [Falkenhainer et al. 1989]) Thus, the 
atom as miniature solar-system is a satisfying analogy  be-
cause both source and target are causally structured around 
the notion of rotation. Furthermore, when comparing agents 
or artefacts (e.g., see [Veale and Keane, 1997]), this causality 
can be captured by considering the functional or behavioural 
commonality between target and source: a footballer can be 
meaningfully described as a gladiator or a warrior since each 
exhibits  competitive  behaviour,  and a  scalpel  can  be  com-
pared to a sabre, a sword or a cleaver since each has a cutting 
behaviour.

By employing a single lexical resource, HowNet, to im-
plement  both  the  taxonomic  abstraction  and the  struc-
ture-mapping theories  of  analogy,  we  have  as a  secondary 
goal a  demonstration that  both  perspectives  are not  funda-
mentally opposed. Structure-mapping can be seen as a form 
of structural-abstraction, where one abstracts out the causal 
backbone of a concept, while taxonomic abstraction, if de-
rived from the relational structure of a concept, can also be 
seen as a highly selective form of structure-mapping.

3 Comparing WordNet and HowNet
HowNet  and  WordNet  each reflect  a different  view  of  se-
mantic organization. WordNet is differential in nature: rather 
than attempting to express the meaning of a word explicitly, 
WordNet  instead  differentiates  words  with  different  mean-
ings by placing them in different synonym sets, and further 
differentiates  these  synsets  from  one  another  by  assigning 
them  to  different  positions  in  its  taxonomy.  In  contrast, 
HowNet is constructive in nature. It does not provide a hu-
man-oriented textual gloss for each lexical concept, but in-
stead combines sememes from a less discriminating taxon-
omy  to  compose  a  semantic representation  of  meaning  for 
each word sense.

For example, the lexical concept surgeon|医生 is given the 

following semantic definition in HowNet:

surgeon|医生{human|人:HostOf={Occupation|职位}, 

domain={medical|医}},

{doctor|医治:agent={~}}}

which can be glossed thus: “a surgeon is a human with an 
occupation in the medical domain who acts as the agent of a 
doctoring  activity.”  The  {~}
construct  serves  as  a 
self-reference,  to  mark  the  location  of  the  concept  being 
defined in the given semantic structure. The oblique refer-
ence offered by the tilde serves to make the definition more
generic,  so  that  many  different  concepts  can  conceivably 
employ the same definition. Thus, HowNet uses the above 
definition not only for surgeon, but for medical workers in 
general, from orderlies to nurses, internists and neurologists.
Perhaps  because  HowNet  relies  less  on hierarchical  dif-
ferentiation,  it  has  a  considerably  less  developed  middle 
ontology than WordNet. For instance, most kinds of person 
in  HowNet,  from  mathematicians  to  hobos,  are  placed  di-

rectly under the hypernym  human|人, eschewing the inter-
like  {professional},  {specialist} and 
mediate  concepts 
{worker} that give substance to WordNet’s middle ontology. 
We note that HowNet does indeed define these concepts –
but unlike WordNet, it does so at the leaf level where they 
add nothing to the internal structure of the taxonomy.

4 Analogy Via Relational Signatures
The  skeletal nature  of  HowNet  semantic  definitions,  com-
bined with the wide-spread use of {~} as a generic reference, 
suggests how HowNet might support an efficient approach to 
analogical  recall.  By  indexing  each  concept  on  a  reduced 
form  of  its  semantic  definition  – a  relational signature  –
analogies  will  correspond  to  collisions  between  concepts 
with different definitions but with identical signatures. Such 
an  approach  can  be  efficiently  implemented  using  simple 
string hashing of signatures, to detect analogical collisions 
between kitchens and factories, generals and admirals, ballet 
dancers and acrobats, or cruise missiles and arrows. The devil 
here is in the lack of detail: because HowNet’s definitions are 
frequently imprecise and fail to fully specify a concept, they 
allows  others  – potential  analogues  – to  occupy  the  same 
reduced semantic space. The further we exacerbate this de-
ficiency, indexing each definition on an increasingly diluted 
version  of  itself,  the  more  distant and  creative  will  be  the 
analogies  that  are  generated.  For  example,  excluding  the 
hypernym of a definition, or its domain markings, facilitates 
analogies between people and non-people, such as pests and 
persecutors, or hackers and viruses.

To implement both the abstraction and structure-mapping 
theories of analogy, we will explore the effectiveness of two 
kinds  of  relational  signatures  in  the  current  work:  atomic 
signatures  based  on  taxonomic  abstraction,  and more  tem-
plate-like  signatures  based  on  generalized  propositional 
content in which place-holder variables have been added. 
4.1 Taxonomic Abstraction with HowNet 
Given  the  general  impoverishment  of  HowNet’s  middle 
ontology (at least compared with that of WordNet), abstrac-
tion-based signatures should not be based directly on taxo-
nomic organization. Rather, by instead deriving taxonomic 
signatures  from  the  relational  structure  of  a  concept’s  se-
mantic definition, we can better capture the functional and 
behavioral nature of the concepts concerned. We can do this 
by focusing on that part of each definition that contains an 
explicit self-reference in the form {~}. For instance, consider 
the following semantic definition of repairman|修理工:

{human|人:HostOf={Occupation|职位}, 

{repair|修理:agent={~}}}

Noting  the  relational  position  of  {~},  we  can  infer  that  a 
repairman is the agent of a repairing activity. Expressing this 
as a taxonomic abstraction, we can reify the combination of 
activity and role to create a new taxonomic term repair-agent, 
of which repairman will be an instance. From an analogical 
perspective,  repair-agent thus  serves  as  a  good  relational 
signature for repairman|修理. 

Further  noting  that  the  HowNet  taxonomy  defines  the 
predicate repair|修理as a specialization of the reinstatement 
predicate resume|恢复, we can further establish repair-agent
as  a  specialization  of  resume-agent.  This  double  layer  of 
abstraction effectively establishes a new, parallel taxonomy 
that organizes lexical-concepts according to their analogical 
potential, rather than their formal taxonomic properties. As 
shown  in  Figure  1 then,  resume-agent will  encompass not 
only repair-agent, but doctor-agent, since HowNet defines 
the predicate doctor|医治as a specialization of resume|恢复.

Figure 1: Portion of a new three-level abstraction hierarchy derived 
from HowNet’s relational structures.

In  general, taxonomic  signatures are  generated as  follows: 
given a semantic fragment F:role={~} in a HowNet defini-
tion  of  a  concept  C,  we  create  the  signatures  F-role and 
F’-role, where F’ is the immediate HowNet hypernym of F, 
which in turn is the immediate hypernym of C.  The role in 
question  might  be  agent,  patient,  instrument,  or  any  other 
role supported by HowNet, such as target, content, etc.

Figure 2: a hierarchy of taxonomic signatures that facilitates anal-
ogy between instruments that “alter the form” of others.

Each concept is thus assigned two different taxonomic sig-
natures:  a  direct  signature  (F-role)  based  on  the  specific 
relational structure of the concept, and another more general 
signature (F’-role) that is abstracted from this direct signa-

ture. These signatures effectively form an alternate taxonomy 
by which the lexical concepts in HowNet can be organized 
for analogical purposes. Figure 2 above illustrates a partial 
hierarchy  derived  from  the  HowNet  semantics  of  various 
form-altering tools.

This additional layer of abstraction is necessary to facili-
tate creative analogy between semantically distant concepts. 
Nonetheless,  we  note  that  since  HowNet’s  designers  have 
already  exercised  a  certain  degree  of  metaphoric  license,
even concepts with the same direct signature can exhibit a 
surprising degree of semantic variety.

This  diversity,  as  illustrated  by  Figure  3,  means  that  the 
analogy  “Death  is  an  assassin”  can  be  generated  without 
recourse to a more abstract signature.
4.2 Structure-Mapping with HowNet 

The structure-mapping approach also strives for abstrac-
tion, not through the selective creation of new taxonyms but 
through a form of structural rarefaction. Structure-mapping 
theory places particular emphasis on the causal backbone of a 
concept’s propositional content, which is usually projected 
unchanged from one domain to another ([Falkenhainer et al.
1989)].  Based  on  this  isomorphic  alignment  of  relational 
structures, the entities contained in each structure are typi-
cally placed into a 1-to-1 correspondence with one another. 
The  attributive  modifiers  of  these  entities  play  a  more  pe-
ripheral  role  in  structure-mapping,  but  in  approaches  like 
Sapper [Veale and Keane, 1997] they often serve as a literal 
grounding for an analogy.

The semantic definitions provided by HowNet are already 
so  skeletal  and  under-specified  that  we  can  operate  on  the 
assumption that they represent the relational backbone of a 
concept’s  meaning.  So  in  generating  a  set  of  struc-
ture-mapping signatures for a given concept, we will assume 
that  each  signature  preserves  the  general  form  of  a  single 
proposition. Consider the HowNet definition of blind person|
盲人:

{human|人:

{disable|知道:

OfPart={part|部件:PartPosition={eye|眼},
whole= {human|人}} 

experiencer={~},
scope={look|看}}}

In other words, a blind person has “a disability of the eye that 
affects one’s ability to look”. One finds precisely the same 
propositional  structure  in  the  HowNet  definition  of  lame 

identifying  eye:leg

person|拐子, except that eye|眼is replaced with leg|腿and 
look|看is  replaced  with  walk|走.  The  goal  of  a  struc-
ture-mapping approach is  to  capture this  semantic isomor-
phism  while 
as 
cross-domain counterparts. One way to do this is to gener-
alize from each definition a signature that, by virtue of iden-
ticality, signals a structural equivalence between individual 
definitions. For instance, the common structural signature for 
blind  person|盲人 and  lame  person|拐子 might  look  like 
this:

and 

look:walk

{?:{ill|病态:OfPart={?},experiencer={~},scope={?}}}

Generalized structural signatures like this can be generated 
using the following 7-step process:

1. Split  each  definition  into  multiple  propositions,  and 

generate a separate signature for each.  

2. If  a  proposition  describes  a  noun  concept,  replace  its 
taxonomic head with a ? marker. In contrast, if a propo-
sition  describes  a  verb  concept,  replace  its  taxonomic 
head with its most specific hypernym. 

3. Replace 

the  conceptual  arguments  bound 

to  each 
case-role  of  a  predicate  with  the  variable  marker  {?}. 
These  markers  will  indicate  positions  in  the  signature 
where 1-to-1 correspondences between source and target 
structures can be made.

4. When  a  propositional  sub-structure  corresponds  to  the 
definition of another HowNet concept, replace the entire 
sub-structure with a {?} variable marker.

5. Replace predicates by their immediate hypernyms in the 
HowNet taxonomy. Thus, both  repair|修理in the defi-
nition of repairman|修理, and doctor|医治in the defini-
tion  of  surgeon|医生 ,  should  be  replaced  by  the  hy-
pernym  resume|恢复 when  generating  their  respective 
signatures.

6. Remove any explicit domain tag in a proposition from the 
the  assignment  do-
corresponding  signature  (e.g., 
main={medical|医}  in  the  definition  of surgeon|医生). 
This  is  necessary  since  analogy  is  meant  to  transcend 
domain boundaries.

7. Generalize  any  attributive  value  to  its  immediate  hy-
pernym. As such, step 3 above should not variablize the 
arguments of the attributive relations modifier, manner, 
restrictive, host or content. 

Following these 7 steps,  the following structural signatures 
will be assigned to each of the concepts surgeon|医生, re-
pairman|修理,  reviser|修订者,  watchmaker|钟表匠 and
herbalist|药农:

{?:HostOf={?}}
{?: resume|恢复:agent={~}}}

[Note: because the HostOf relation always  occurs with the 
binding Occupation|职位in HowNet, only the latter signa-
ture is retained as an analogical index]
More structural richness is exhibited by the lexical concepts 
apostle|使徒and insider|局内人, whose HowNet definitions 
are shown below.

apostle|使徒

 {human|人:

{believe|修理:
agent={~}, 
content={humanized|拟人},
domain={religion|宗教}}}

person who knows inside story|个中人

 {human|人:

{know|知道:

agent={~}, 
content={fact|事情:

modifier=covert|隐秘}}}

These are also assigned the same structural signature:

signature {?: {HaveKnowledge|有知:

agent={~}, 
content={?}}

The  sub-structure  {fact|事情:modifier=covert|隐秘} has 
been completely variablized within the signature of person 
who knows inside story|个中人since this corresponds to the 
HowNet definition of secret|秘事(see step 4). Analogically 
then, an apostle is a religious insider who knows the inside 
scoop on a deity (denoted humanized|拟人in HowNet).

5 Comparative Evaluation
Consider first the composition of the HowNet version used in 
this  research.  It  contains  95,407  unique  lexical  concepts 
(excluding  synonyms)  and  23,507  unique  semantic  defini-
tions. Clearly then, these definitions are under-specified to 
the  extent  that  many  are  shared  by  non-identical  concepts 
(such as cart|板车and bicycle|单车, which HowNet simply 
defines  as  manual  vehicles).  Furthermore,  90%  of  these 
definitions comprise a single proposition, while 8% comprise 
two propositions and only 2% comprise three or more.

We  evaluate  the  taxonomic  and  structure-mapping  ap-
proaches  using  four  criteria:  coverage – the  percentage  of 
unique HowNet definitions from which a valid signature can 
be derived; recall – the percentage of definitions for which at 
least  one  analogical  counterpart  can  be  found;  parsi-
mony/precision – the percentage of effective signatures that 
can actually be used to generate analogies (since a parsimo-
nious approach will precisely generate just those signatures 
that are analogically useful); and richness – the complexity of 
the mappings involved, as measured by the average number 
of entity correspondences per analogy. 

5.1 Evaluating Taxonomic Abstraction 
5.1.1  Taxonomic Coverage 
Since  taxonomic  signatures  exploit  occurrences  of {~} for 
their  generation,  both the  coverage  and recall  of  the taxo-
nomic  abstraction  approach  depend  crucially  on 
the 
wide-spread usage of this reflexive construct. 

However, of the 23,507 unique definitions in HowNet, just  
6430 employ this form of self-reference. The coverage of-
fered by taxonomic signatures is therefore just 27% of the 
available definitions.
5.1.2  Taxonomic Recall 
For these 6430 self-referential definitions, 1579 unique direct 
signatures are  generated.  In  turn, another  838  abstract  sig-
natures are derived from these via predicate generalization. 
In  total,  2219  unique  taxonomic  signatures  are  generated, 
revealing that in 8% of cases, the abstract signature of one 
definition corresponds to the direct signature of another.

A  majority  of  these  signatures  (59%)  serve  to  generate 
analogies  for  6184  semantic  definitions. The  overall recall 
rate then is 26%. The most productive taxonomic signature is 
control_agent,  which  serves  to  analogically  co-index  210 
unique definitions.
5.1.3  Taxonomic Parsimony/Precision 
Overall, 1,315 of all 2219 taxonomic signatures prove useful 
in co-indexing two or more definitions, while 904 taxonomic 
signatures  are associated  with  just a  single definition. The 
parsimony of the taxonomic approach is thus 59%.  
5.1.4  Taxonomic Richness 
Only  one  mapping, at  the  gross  level  of  source  and  target 
concepts, can be generated by the taxonomic approach. For 
instance, the approach can recognize that  blind person|盲人
and lame person|拐子are analogous by virtue of sharing the 
taxonomic signature disable-experiencer. However, it cannot 
recursively  determine  the  entity  mappings  eye:leg and 
look:walk.  The  taxonomic  approach  thus  has  a  uniform 
mapping richness of 1.  
5.2 Evaluating Structure-Mapping 
5.2.1  Structure-Mapping Coverage 
A  structure-mapping  signature  can  be  generated  for  every 
semantic  definition  in  HowNet.  In  principle  then,  the  cov-
erage of this approach is 100%. In practice, however, 10% of 
HowNet’s  semantic  definitions  contain no  real  structure 
beyond the specification of a hypernym or a domain tag. The 
maximum coverage of structure-mapping then, as limited to 
definitions with relational structure, is 90%.
5.2.2  Structure-Mapping Recall 
HowNet’s  21,761  unique  structured  definitions  comprise 
21,929  unique  propositions.  From  these,  21,159  unique 
structural signatures are derived (many are generalizations of 
other signatures), serving to find analogues for 14,370 defi-
nitions. The recall for structure-mapping is thus 61%. 

The most productive structural signature is:
{component.部分:whole={?}}

which serves to analogically co-index 397 unique semantic 
definitions.
5.2.3  Structure-Mapping Parsimony/Precision 
With 79% of all structural signatures serving to index just a 
single  definition,  the  parsimony  of  the  structure-mapping 
approach must be judged as a low 21%.    
5.2.4  Structure-Mapping Richness 
Most analogies (64%) generated using the structure-mapping 
approach imply two entity mappings, 25% imply three entity 
mappings, and 11% imply four or more. The average map-
ping richness of a structure-mapped analogy is thus 2.48.
5.3 Analysis of Results 
The  results  of  this  comparison,  as  summarized  in  Table  1 
below, force us to draw some important conclusions about 
the utility of HowNet for analogy.

First, though the taxonomic approach is capped by the lim-
ited  use  of  self-reference  among  HowNet  definitions,  it 
demonstrates a recall rate that closely approaches this ceiling, 
managing to find analogies of non-trivial complexity for 1 in 
4  HowNet  definitions.  Because  of  its  broader  coverage, 
structure-mapping  does  considerably  better,  generating 
analogies for 3 in 5 definitions. A combination of both ap-
proaches  (“combo”  in Table  1)  generates analogies  for  al-
most 3 in 4 definitions, which is most encouraging given the 
creative demands of analogy generation. This is especially so 
as we have considered here analogies between unique defi-
nitions, not unique words. A given definition-level analogy 
can  be  lexically  realized in  many,  sometimes hundreds,  of 
different ways.

6 Conclusions and Future Work
We conclude then that HowNet contains sufficient structure 
to  realistically  support  both  a  taxonomic  abstraction  view 
and a structure-mapping view of analogy generation. None-
theless, we need to investigate additional sources of semantic 
content to further increase the recall of the abstraction ap-
proach. For this, we must turn to the implicit content hidden 
in HowNet’s lexico-semantic structure.

Perhaps  surprisingly,  one  source  of  implicit  semantic 
content is orthography. Most Chinese entries in HowNet are 
multi-character  – and thus multi-morpheme – terms whose 
composite orthography affords a kind of semantic transpar-
ency that other writing systems (e.g., that of English) do not 
possess. Thus, 手术刀, meaning “scalpel”, is a composite not 
just of characters but of ideas, for 手术 means “surgery” and 
刀 means  “knife”.  Likewise,  哲学家,  which  translates  as

学and even midwifery|产科学. By decomposing compound 
terms in this way, and by generalizing the extracted modifiers, 
a  three-level  taxonomy  can  be  constructed  to  complement 
that which is formed by taxonomic signatures. From these 
examples  alone,  the  partial  taxonomy  of  Figure  4  can  be 
derived:

knowledge-human

mathematics-human

mathematician|数学家

philosophy-human

philosopher|哲学家

midwifery-human

midwife|产科

Buddhism-human

Buddhist|佛教徒

Figure 4: Portion of an alternate three-level hierarchy derived from 
Chinese compound terms (prefix term + hypernym).

The  analogical  potential  of  such  an  alternative  signature 
scheme becomes clear when one notices that it immediately 
supports Plato’s classical analogy of philosopher as midwife.
