The primary objective of this work is to categorize
the  available  fly  ashes  in  different  parts  of  the

self-
organizing  feature  map  and  radial  basis  function
networks  are  utilized  for  the  classification  of  fly 
ashes  in  terms  of  its  chemical  parameters.  The 
basic  procedure  of  the  methodology  consists  of 
three  stages:  (1)  apply  self –organizing neural net 
and  delineate  distinct  groups  of  fly  ashes  and 
identify  the  group  sensitive  attributes;  (2)  find 
mean  values  of  sensitive  attributes  of  the  elicited 
groups and augment them as start-up prototypes for 
k-means algorithm and find the refined centroids of 
these  groups;  (3)  incorporate the centroids in a two 
layer  radial  basis  function  network  and  refine  the 
delineation of the groups and develop an indexing 
equation  using 
the  stabilized 
network.  Further,  to  demonstrate  the  utility of this 
classification  scheme,  the  so  formed  groups  were 
correlated with their performance in High Volume 
Fly  Ash  Concrete  System        [HVFAC].    The 
categorization  was  found  to  be  excellent  and 
compares  well  with  Canadian Standard 
Association’s [CSA A 3000] classification scheme.

1 Introduction
Cement  is  the  most  cost  and  energy –intensive component 
of  concrete.  The  unit  cost  of  concrete  can  be  reduced  by 
partial  replacement  of  cement  with  fly  ash.  Fly  ash  is  the 
byproduct  of  the  combustion  of  pulverized  coal  and  is 
collected  by  mechanical  and  electrostatic  separators  from 
the fuel gases of power plants where coal is used as a fuel. 
High-volume  fly  ash  concrete  has  emerged  as  construction 
material  in  its  own  right.  Published  literature  contains  a 

large amount  of  data  on  properties  of  structural  concretes 
containing  10  to  30  percent  fly  ash  by  weight  of  the  total 
cementitious  material  (i.e.  cement  +  fly  ash)  .For  most 
structural  applications  except  mass  concrete,  the  fly  ash 
content is often limited to 20-30%. The quality of fly ash is 
often  specified  by  standards  in  terms  of  fineness,  loss  on 
its  chemical  constituents.
ignition  and 
However,  to  the  concrete  technologist  and  the  design 
engineer,  the  more  important  factors  are  the  influences  of
fly ash  on  properties such as workability, heat of hydration, 
strength  or  durability. Besides the effects of fly ash on the 
properties  of  concrete,  fly  ash  also  affects  the  cost  of  the 
concrete product.

limitation  of 

The  cost  of  fly  ash  is  generally  one-third [Ho and Lewis,
1985].  High  volume  fly  ash  concrete  [HVFAC]  is  ideally 
suited for rigid pavement construction to meet the projected 
needs  of  interstate highway & major constructions in India 
[Bilodeau  and  Malhotra,  2000;Mullik,  2005].  This  paper 
reports an attempt made to classify the fly ashes into groups 
using  the  available data. Such grouping of data is useful for 
a  concrete  technologist for expeditious use of certain kinds 
of  fly  ashes  in  HVFAC  system.  However,  chemical 
composition of fly ashes is considered in this work as they 
play a significant role in fly ash concrete and also there is 
variability in their proportions.
2. Specific Attributes of Fly Ashes
There  exists  a  considerable  variability  in  concrete  related 
characteristics of fly ashes between typical low-calcium and 
typical high-calcium 
fly  ashes.  At  present  ASTM 
specifications  call  low  calcium  as  “class  F”  fly  ashes  and 
high-calcium  as  “class-C” fly ashes. Low calcium fly ashes 
have their origin in bituminous coal while high calcium fly 
ashes  are  due  to  burning  of  coals  with  high  limestone.
However, this classification is solely based on percentage of 
in  chemical 
calcium  oxide  present.  The  differences

composition of these two kinds of fly ashes is palpable. The 
silica  contents  of  high  calcium  fly  ashes  are somewhat 
variable  [Mullik,2005].  Alumina  contents  may  not  be  as 
variable.Iron  oxide  contents  of  low  calcium  are  usually 
higher  than  that  of  high  calcium  fly  ashes.  A  Cao  content 
upto  29%  is  reported  .Fly  ashes  with  intermediate  Cao 
contents  have  their  origin  in  sub  bituminous  coal.The 
remaining  chemical  constituents  like  MgO,  SO3,  K 2O,
Na2O3 and TiO2 are considered to be of less importance , but 
this  is  not  necessarily  so[Diamond,  1984].  The  MgO 
contents  of  high  calcium  fly  ashes  are  usually  quite  high. 
Higher SO3  contents  in  high  Many  low  calcium  fly  ashes 
have substantially more K2O than Na2O. On the other hand,
many high calcium fly ashes have more Na2O than K2O. It 
is  concluded  that  except  for  calcium  content  variations  of 
other  chemical  constituents  of fly ash appeared to have no 
effect  on  its  reactivity  [Mehta,  1985].  The  particle  size 
distribution is important parameter governing the reactivity 
of  fly  ash.  For  low  calcium  fly  ashes  the  reactivity  was 
found to be directly proportional to the amount of particles
<10mm,  and 
inversely  proportional  to  particles  >45mm.
High calcium fly ashes seem to be relatively less sensitive to 
particle size distribution [Mehta, 1985]. 
3. Significance of the Work
There  have  been  many  reported  applications  of  neural 
networks in civil engineering [Adeli, 2001]. In particular, an 
attempt  to  classify  soils  by  using  feed  forward  neural 
network  with  back  propagation  learning  algorithm  is  also 
reported [Cal, 1995]. The primary objective of this work is 
to categorize  fly  ashes  from  different  sources  into  distinct 
groups as guided by self-organized feature maps considering 
chemical  constituents  as  inputs.  The  main  purpose  of 
classifying  fly  ashes  for  use  in  concrete  is  to  distinguish 
between ashes that have different effects on the properties of 
fresh  and  hardened  concrete.  In  ASTM  C618  these  are 
referred to as Class F and Class C fly ash. Whereas in the 
Canadian  Standard  Association’s  CSA  A  3000, 
the 
approach  adopted  was  to  use  the  total  calcium  content 
(expressed  as  mass  %  of  calcium  oxide)  as  the  basis  of 
classification.  The  three  categories  of  ash  characterized  as 
being 
intermediate  and  high  calcium  content. 
Accordingly,  the  classes  have  been  named  as  F-type with 
CaO at less that 8%, CI-type with CaO between 8% to 20% 
and  CH-type with CaO more than 20%.  However, both the 
approaches rely on percentage of CaO as the sole criterion 
for classification. This is because; many researchers have
demonstrated that the role of fly ash in concrete is strongly 
influenced  by  the  calcium  content  of  the  ash.  Thomas  et 
all[1999] provide a rationale for CSA A3000 approach.

In  this  study,  Kohonen’s  self-organizing  feature  map  and 
radial  basis  function  networks  have  been  integrated  in  a 
cascading  fashion.  The  data  for  the  classification  was
garnered  from  standard  published  references.  The  basic 
procedure of the methodology consists of three stages: 

(1) Apply  Kohonen’s  self–organizing  neural  net  and 
delineate  distinct  groups  of  fly  ashes  in  terms  of 
winning  neurons  and  identify  the  group  sensitive
attributes.

(2) Find mean attribute values of sensitive parameters 
of the elicited groups and augment them as start-up
prototypes  for  k-means  algorithm  and  find  the
refined centroids of these groups.

(3) Incorporate the so obtained centroids in a two-layer

radial  basis  function  network  and  refine  the
delineation of the groups and develop an indexing 
equation  using 
the  stabilized 
network.

Further,  to  demonstrate  the  utility  of  this  classification
scheme, the  so  formed  groups  were  then  correlated with 
their  performance  in  High  Volume  Fly  Ash  Concrete 
System    [HVFAC].

4. Kohonen’s Feature Maps

that 

forms  clusters  of  neurons 

The self-organizing  map  (TPFM)  network  performs
unsupervised  learning  [Kohonen,  1997].  It  is  a  neural 
network 
that  reflect 
similarities  in  the  input  vector.  It  is  a  mapping  that  is 
defined  implicitly  and  not  explicitly.  This  is  desirable
because  this  investigation is not restricted to any particular 
application or predefined  categories.  Input  vectors  are 
presented sequentially in time without specifying the output. 
Because  of  this  fact,  there  is  no  way  of  predicting  which 
neuron will be associated with a given class of input vectors.
This  mapping  is  accomplished  after  training  the  network. 
The  network  has  a  sequential  structure  starting  with  the d
input  vectors  (input  neurons) x, which are received by the n
neurons in parallel and are scaled by the weight vector w. 
Thus the weight   matrix is the size of n neurons by d inputs.
A  thorough  treatment of the network is beyond the scope of 
this paper. Elaborative presentations about the network are 
found  in  references  [Kohonen,  1997;  Oppenheim  and 
Willsky, 1983; Demuth and Beale, 1997; Schalkoff, 1992]. 

4.1 Application

The  chemical  composition  of fly  ashes  plays  a  significant 
role in HVFAC. But, the important factor  that  has  hindered 
the  widespread  use  of  ashes  is  their  variability.  No  two 
ashes  are  completely alike. The need to characterize them in 
terms  of  their  chemical  and  host  of  other  parameters
relevant  to  engineering  use  is  urgent  and  real  [Swamy, 
1985].  However,  in  this  study,  only  chemical  attributes  of 
the fly ashes were considered. 
Data for this classification work was availed from the listed 
references  [Sivasundaram  and  Malhotra,2004;Ozvildirim
and Halsted,1994; Fornier et al,2004; Bilodeau et al ,1994;

learning 

contained 

refere n c e s  e ven 

et al ,2000; Zhang et al,1999; Malhotra,1990]. In all, about 
80 sets of data were gathered. To begin with, eight chemical 
attributes, viz., Sio2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, CaO, MgO, Na2O3, K2O,
SO3  or  TiO2  of  fly  ash  were  considered  for  classification. 
Among  these  attributes,  the  sulphur  dioxide is predominant 
in  high  calcium  fly  ashes  and  was  found  to  be  not 
appreciable  in  low  calcium  fly  ashes.  The  reverse  was  the 
trend 
the  case  of  Titanium  oxide  i.e,  appreciable 
percentage of  titanium  oxide  was  reported  in  low  calcium
fly ashes. Therefore, they are together taken as one attribute. 
Among these 80 data sets, eight records were rejected due to 
non-availability      of  data  concerned  to  some  chemical 
compositions.  Some 
the 
information  about  the  source  of  the  fly  ash  also.    The 
remaining 72 data sets were normalized and shuffled using a 
random sampling. 
Two  start  with;  three  topologies  i.e.,  8-16, 8-24  and  8-32
were  considered  to  pick  out  the  best  possible one. The 
number  of  output  neurons  was  set  as  multiples  of  input 
neurons.  It  is  recommended  that  [Okine  2001]  before 
learning process starts, network coefficients should be sized 
and ascertained.  These  parameters  govern  the  network-
learning  rate, 
iteration,  process  and  weight 
updating, etc. The following are the parameters that must be 
ascertained before training the network:
Kohonen output neurons: This is the estimation of number
of  kohonen  cells.  The  output  neurons  were  considered as 
multiples of  input  neurons.  Three  combinations 8-16, 8-24
and 8-32 were explored. Later, inputs were reduced to 4.
Learning coefficient:  The  learning  coefficient  must  be 
estimated  before  the  network  actually  undergoes  learning.
After  sufficient  learning  cycles,  it  was e stimated  that  the 
learning rate would start from 0.2 for the best training of the 
network to achieve good results.
Number of steps: This is the number of learning iterations.
After  observing  the  performance  of  the  network  after 
sufficient training and comparison of results, it was assumed
to be 10,000.
Neighborhood size:  The  neighborhood  size  is  used  in  the 
self-organizing  phase  of  the  learning  when  the  winning PE 
and  all 
input  PE. 
Neighborhood  size  of  5  was  used  in  all  the topologies
mentioned. Later, the size was reduced to 3.

set. The parameters are summarized in table 1.

4.2 Group Sensitive Attributes

A host of first trials with eight attributes were proved to be 
elusive  in  terms  of  distinct  numbered      winning  neurons 
designating  the  grouping.  However,  three  groups  were
predominantly seen, with more than one neuron indexing to 
the  same  group.  On  successive  elimination  of  some 
chemical  attributes,  the  classification  started  converging. 
Four  chemical  attributes,  i.e.,  SiO2, Al2O3, CaO  and  SO3/
TiO2  were  found  to  be  sensitive  in  the  classification 
process.  To  validate  this  observation,  three  different  net 
topologies 4-8, 4-12  and  4-16  were  tested  with  randomly 
arranged  data  sets.  All  the  topologies  conclusively  proved 
that  these  attributes  are  indeed  more  crucial  in  the 
classification. However, the   results of the first topology (4-
8) were considered. A stastical picture of the group sensitive 
attribute data is presented in table 2. It should be noted that, 
these data sets do not fit a normal distribution pattern.

The  published  research  work  on  high  volume  fly  ash
concrete emphasizes that the percentage of calcium oxide in 
fly  ash  as  the  decisive  parameter  in  long-term performance
of high volume fly ash concrete. Therefore, the sensitivity of 
classification lies in the correlation of other attributes with 
that of calcium oxide. Figure 1 shows correlation between 
calcium  oxide  and  silicon  oxide.  In  this  plot,  higher 
percentage of calcium oxide corresponds to lower amount of 
silicon  dioxide  and  vice  versa  with  moderate  percentage
ranges of both in the midst.  In fig 2, the correlation between 
calcium oxide and ferric oxide is not that marked. There is a 
fair  correlation  between  calcium  oxide  and  sulphur 
oxide/titanium oxide as portrayed in fig 3.

5. K-Means Algorithm
The  simplicity  of 
combined with its capability to produce good results, makes 
it the most widely known clustering method. The purpose of 
applying the k-means clustering algorithm is to find a set of 
clustered  centers  and  a  partition  of  training  data  into 
subclasses. Normally, the center of each cluster is initialized 
to  a  randomly  chosen  input  datum.  Then  each  training 
datum is assigned to the cluster that is nearest to itself. In 
this  case,  the  initial  prototypes  were  those  found  by  self-
organizing network. After training data have been assigned 
to a new cluster unit, the new center of a cluster represents 
the average of the training data associated with that cluster 
unit.  After  all  the  new  clusters  have  been  calculated,  the 
process is repeated until it converges. The refined prototypic 
values  of  three  groups  after  the  successful  execution  of  k-
means algorithm are presented in table 4.

8. Conclusions
This  paper  presented  an  analytical oriented, attribute-based
model for classification of fly ashes into three groups using 
SOFM and RBFN. Using the weights of a stabilized RBFN, 
an  indexing  equation  has  been  developed.  The  equation 
consists of predetermined group centers (prototypes) and the
coefficients aij  and  bj.  The  performance  evaluation  of  the 
groups  with  the  corresponding  range  of  values  of  group 
sensitive attributes is presented in table 7. It is felt that, from 
the  end  user  (scientists  and  engineers)  point  of  view, 
outcome of the model is significant on following counts;

§

§

The classification considers four sensitive chemical 
attributes of fly ashes. 
This classification highlights the correlation among 
certain  group  sensitive  attributes  like  Silicon
oxide, Calcium oxide, Sulphur  oxide  and  Titanium 
oxide.

§ With  the  indexing  equation  and  known  attribute
values of a given fly ash, it is possible to provide a 
first  hand  information  about  the  properties  of  the 
fly  ash  and  how  &  where  it  should  be  used  for  a 
given application.
