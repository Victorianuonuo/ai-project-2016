Abstract 

In  this  paper,  we  evaluate  the  use  of implicit  in(cid:173)
terest  indicators  as  the  basis  for  user  profiling  in 
the  Digital  TV  domain.  Research  in  more  tradi(cid:173)
tional  domains,  such  as  Web  browsing  or  Usenet 
News,  indicates that  some  implicit  interest indica(cid:173)
tors (e.g., read-time and mouse movements) are ca(cid:173)
pable of serving as alternative to explicit profile in(cid:173)
formation such as user ratings.  Consequently,  the 
key question we wish to answer relates to the type 
of implicit  indicators  that  can  be  identified  within 
the DTV domain  and the extent to which they  can 
accurately reflect a user's true preferences. 

Introduction 

1 
Rccommcndcr  systems  combine  user  profiling,  machine 
learning and information  retrieval  methods to help  users  lo(cid:173)
cate  information  by  learning  their  preferences  and  making 
personalized  recommendations  to  individuals  ([Hammond 
et  al,  1996;  Balabanovic  and  Shoham,  1997;  Smyth  and 
Cotter,  2000;  Good  et  al,  1999;  Goldberg  et  al.,1992]). 
There  are  two  basic  profiling  strategies.  Explicit  profiling 
means  asking  the  user  direct  questions  about  their  prefer(cid:173)
ences,  usually  in  the  form  of an  item  rating;  e.g. 
in  PTV-
Plus  (www.ptvplus.com),  a  TV  show  recommender  [Smyth 
and  Cotter,  2001;  2000],  users  rate  individual  shows  on  a 
five point  scale  from  'strong  dislike'  to  'strong  like'.  Ex(cid:173)
plicit profiling  has  been  used  in  a  range  of scenarios,  from 
movies  [Resnick  et  al.,  1994]  to jobs  [Rafter  et  ai,  2000], 
and the resulting profiles are assumed to be reliable  indica(cid:173)
tors of user preferences.  However, users are lazy and do not 
like responding to explicit requests for feedback.  As a result 
explicit profiles often contain few ratings, which can limit the 
degree to which they will accurately reflect a user's changing 
preferences over time. 

Implicit profiling  methods  construct  user  profiles  by  infer-
ring user ratings  from  so-called  interest  indicators  based  on 
user's  interactions  with  the  system  [Claypool  et  al.,  2001; 
Goecks and Shavlik,  1999].  For example, [Morita and Shin-
oda,  1994;  Konstan  et ai,  1997;  Claypool  et  al,  2001]  re(cid:173)
port a positive correlation between reading times (for Usenet 
News and Web pages)  and content ratings.  [Claypool  et ai, 
2001]  shows a correlation between content ratings and  both 

mouse  movements and  scrolling  although mouse  movement 
was only found to be a useful rating predictor at lower rating 
levels.  Interestingly,  [Claypool et ai, 2001] finds no correla(cid:173)
tion between user ratings and the number of clicks to links on 
a Web page. 

In this paper we seek to evaluate the use of implicit profil(cid:173)
ing in a very different application domain, Digital TV (DTV). 
DTV users are  finding  it increasingly difficult to identify rele(cid:173)
vant TV shows among the hundreds of available channels and 
recommender systems such as PTVPlus have been forwarded 
as a potential solution  [Smyth and Cotter,  2000],  PTVPlus 
uses its recommendation engine to generate a set of TV  pro(cid:173)
gramme  recommendations  for  a  target  user  based  on  their 
profiled  interests  using  a  combination  of collaborative  and 
case-based strategies, and presents these recommendations in 
the form of a personalized programme guide.  So far research 
in the area of personalisation and recommendation within the 
DTV  domain  has  focused  almost  exclusively  on  the  use  of 
explicit profiling.  Consequently, the key question we wish to 
answer  relates  to  the  type  of implicit  interest  indicators  that 
can  be  identified  within  the  DTV  domain  and the  extent  to 
which they can accurately reflect a user's true preferences. 

Implicit Ratings in the DTV Domain 

2 
In  this  research  we  use  the  Fischlar  video  library  system 
[Lee et ai,  2000]  developed  by the  Centre  for Digital  Video 
Processing  at  Dublin  City  University  (www.cdvp.dcu.ie). 
Fischlar has been fully operational for a number of years and 
attracts hundreds of users on a regular basis.  It is a video li(cid:173)
brary system that allows users to record, playback and browse 
TV  shows  through  a  normal  Web  browser.  Users  browse 
personalized television schedules,  provided by the  PTVPlus 
personalization  engine  [Smyth  and  Cotter,  2000],  to  select 
programmes  to  be  recorded  by  the  system.  TV  shows  are 
captured in MPEG-1  format and processed in order to index 
their content for storage and to extract key-frames for content-
based  browsing.  Fischlar  users  can  select  programmes  to 
record up to 2  days  in  advance of broadcast and can  access 
previously recorded programmes for playback or browsing. 

As  Fischlar  takes  advantage  of the  PTVPlus  personalized 
TV listings service, there exists the ability to capture explicit 
ratings feedback for its user profiles (Figure  1) using the rat(cid:173)
ing  icons  beside  each  programme's  description.  However, 
unlike PTVPlus, Fischlar users can interact directly with pro-

gramming content, and this provides new profiling opportuni(cid:173)
ties.  In particular, the record, playback and browsing actions 
of users are suitable as implicit interest indicators; e.g., select(cid:173)
ing a programme to be recorded is surely a strong potential 
indicator  of interest.  Thus,  Fischlar's  profiling  capabilities 
have been enhanced to capture implicit as well as the explicit 
profiles, by logging all record, playback and browsing actions 
(Figure 2).

3  Experimental Evaluation 
Our  aim  is  to  evaluate  the  usefulness  of Fischlar's  implicit 
user profiles  relative to  its explicit profiles.  In  particular we 
wish  to  determine  whether or not  these  implicit profiles  are 
any more or less accurate at predicting user preferences than 
the explicit profiles gathered directly from user ratings. 

3.1  Test  Data 
Our  experiments  draw  on  650  live-user  profiles  from  the 
Fischlar  system. 
In  particular  we  make  use  of  5  different 
types  of profile: 

1. Explicit  profiles  contain  explicit  ratings  that  Fischlar 

users have provided; 

2.  Play profiles contain only those programmes that a user 

has played back; 

3.  Record  profiles  contain  only  those  programmes  that  a 

user has recorded; 

4.  Browse profiles contains only those profiles that a  user 

has browsed using Fischlar's key-frame browser; 

5.  Combined profiles are a combination of play, record and 

browse profiles. 

3.2  Algorithms 
In addition we make use of two different programme recom-
menders: 

2.  Sim  is  a  similarity-based  recommender  that  draws  on 
similarity  information  mined  from  user profiles  as  de(cid:173)
scribed in [O'Sullivan et al., 2002b].  It uses data mining 
techniques  to  find  relationship  between  items  and then 
harnesses this information both in profile similarity and 
recommendation  ranking  (ranking  all  possible  recom-
mendable  programmes)  to  recommend  programmes  to 
the user. 

Due  to  space  constraints,  it  is  not possible  to  discuss  these 
recommenders  in  detail;  the  interested  reader  is  referred  to 
[O'Sullivan  et  al.,  2002b;  2002a].  Suffice  it  to  say  that 
they each draw on a fundamentally different recommendation 
strategy,  be it collaborative as in the case of CF, or content-
based, as in Sim. 
3.3  Method 
First each profile is randomly split into a training profile and a 
test profile; this is repeated for a range of different split-ratios 
for each  profile.  The training profiles  are  used as the basis 
for recommendation;  in  each  case  we  make  50 programme 
recommendations  for  each  user.  The  quality  of the  result(cid:173)
ing recommendations is evaluated with  reference to the cor(cid:173)
responding test profiles by  computing the percentage  of rec(cid:173)
ommended programmes that appear in the target test profile. 
So,  for example,  we  use the training  play  profiles  to gener(cid:173)
ate  recommendations  that  are  evaluated  with  respect  to  the 
test play profiles; similarly for record and browse profiles.  In 
this way we can compare the quality of the recommendations 
generated using implicit play, record,  browse and combined 
indicators to the quality of recommendations generated using 
explicit ratings profiles. 

3.4  Results 

Figure 3:  Recommendation accuracy for explicit and implicit 
(play, record, browse, combined) profile groups. 

1.  CF is a traditional  collaborative  filtering  recommender 
as described in  [Konstan et  al.,  1997; O'Sullivan et al.,  
2002b];  it  finds  similar  users  by  calculating  program 
overlap between the target user and all others, and then 
recommends to the target user programs from the most 
similar users that they have yet not rated. 

The results are presented in Figure 3  as an accuracy bar-
graph  for  the  various  different  groups  of  explicit  and  im(cid:173)
plicit profiles (play,  record,  browse and combined).  In each 
grouping we present the accuracy results obtained by the CF 
and  Sim  recommenders.  For example,  we  find  that the  ex(cid:173)
plicit profiles deliver recommendation accuracies of 2.5% and 

1352

15%,  for  CF  and  Sim  recommenders,  respectively;  clearly 
the  enhanced  Sim  rccommcndcr  offers  significant  benefits 
over the standard CF recommender as previously discussed in 
[CTSullivan et ai,  2002b].  Each  of the  implicit profiles gen(cid:173)
erate consistently higher recommendation accuracies for both 
CF and  Sim recommenders.  For instance,  in the case of the 
play profiles,  the  recommendation  accuracy  is 9% and  30% 
for the CF and Sim recommenders, which is a significant in(cid:173)
crease on the explicit profile accuracy, especially  for the Sim 
rccommcndcr.  In fact,  the  implicit profiles yield  recommen(cid:173)
dation accuracies in excess of 20% for the Sim recommender 
compared to the  15% obtained for the explicit profiles. 

These  results  indicate  that playback,  recording,  browsing 
and combined behaviours in Fischlar serve as competent in(cid:173)
terest indicators when  it comes to profiling user preferences. 
In each case we find an increase in the quality of recommen(cid:173)
dations  made  from  profiles  containing  implicit  information. 
Moreover,  the  scale  of this  increase  is  largest  in  the  case  of 
the Sim recommender, due to the fact that this recommender 
directly  mines  the  profiles  in  order  to  generate  programme 
similarity knowledge as the basis for recommendations.  The 
availability of the higher quality implicit profiles helps to im(cid:173)
prove the similarity rules used by Sim when compared to the 
similarity rules mined from explicit profiles. 

4  Conclusions 
We  have  evaluated  the  use  of implicit  interest  indicators  as 
the basis for user profiling  in the  DTV  domain.  Research  in 
more  traditional  domains,  such  as  Web browsing  or Usenet 
News,  indicates  that  some  implicit  interest  indicators  (e.g., 
read-time  and  mouse  movements)  are  capable  of serving  as 
reliable  alternatives  to  explicit  profile  information  such  as 
user ratings.  Our research indicates that the same is also true 
in the DTV domain. We have compared the quality of recom(cid:173)
mendations generated  from  explicit and  implicit profiles and 
found,  through  the  use  of a  deployed  video  library  system, 
that in each case  the implicit profiles are capable of generat(cid:173)
ing recommendations that are as good as those generated by 
the explicit profiles.
