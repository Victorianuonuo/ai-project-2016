model  is 
to  think  of  it  as  a  signal  flow

If  the  assumption  is 

If  this  model  is  used  for  the  simu­

of  a  sample  of  subjects,  a  number  of 
qualitative  and  quantitative  conclusions 
can  be  reached. 
made  that  the  transition  rate  is  the  same 
for  a ll  subjects,  then  the  response 
latency  w i ll  depend  on  the  number  of 
transitions  made  by  the  word  store. 
we  also  assume  that  the  network  structure 
is  the  same  for  a ll  subjects  (clearly  an 
over-simplification),  then  associative 
response  probability  corresponds  to  the 
total  transmittance  between  a  node  pair, 
taking  into  account  a ll  possible  pathways 
up  to  some  limiting  length. 
Then  the 
monotonic  decreasing  function  relating 
latency  to  probability,  described  by 
Woodworth  and  Schlosberg24  follows  from 
the  model,  since  activity  w i ll  build  up 
more  quickly  at  the  nodes  which  have  a 
strong  total  transmittance  leading  to 
them  from  the  stimulus  node.

The  response  probability  distribu­

tion  has  been  obtained  by  simulation  and 
is  compared  with  some  independent  empiri­

involved  in  deriving  the  network  data 
(described  in  more  detail15).

Finally,  we  reproduce  here  Table  1 

the  columns  marked 

from  Kiss15  to  show  the  comparison  be­
tween  simulation  and  empirical  data. 
The  column  marked  ps  shows  the  simulated 
probabilities,  and 
PM1  and  PM2  show  the  probabilities 
obtained 
from  1,000  subjects  at  Minne­
sota  in  1954  and  1964  respectively.  A 
star  in  the  pm2  column  means  that  the 
probability  is  not  known,  only  the  fact 
that  the  word  does  occur  (this  is  due  to 
the  peculiarities  of  the  tabulation  in 
the  Minnesota  data,  see  Palermo  and 

-705-

Jenkins17). 
It  can  be  seen  that  80  per 
cent  of  the  words  retrieved  by  the  model 
are  in  the  Minnesota  data. 
The  correla­
tion  between  the  simulation  and  the 
Minnesota  data  is 
r=0.578.  This  simula­
tion  involved  letting  the  word  store  run 
through  three  transitions. 
comparisons  have  been  made  when  the  stim­
ulus  consists  of  three  words,  for  example 
moth  bird  fly.12 
The  difference  here  is 
that  a  starting  state  is  set  up  in  which 
several  words  have  nonzero  a c t i v i t i e s. 
The  correlation  between  the  empirical  and 
simulated  probabilities  was  r=0.73. 

Similar 

Response  Sequences 

In  many  experiments  the  subject  is 

required  to  emit  a  sequence  of  responses. 
Responses  which  are  acceptable  can  be 
specified  in  a  number  of  ways.  Bousfield 
and  Sedgewick1  asked  subjects  to  generate 
members  of  some  class,  like  four-legged 
animals,  names  of  c i t i e s,  etc. 
r e s t r i c t i v e l y,  the  subject  may  be  asked 
to  generate  a  continuous  sequence  of  word 
associations  to  a  stimulus  word.  One 
may  also  consider  the  free  recall  of  a 
word  l i st  as  a  highly  restricted  case  of 
this  process. 

Less 

How  does  the  word  store  model  cope 
with  this  situation? 
It  is  assumed  that 
there  are  two  components,  carried  out  by 
the  parallel  and  serial  processors  res­
pectively. 
The  parallel  processor  is 
generating  candidate  items  which  are  then 
tested  for  acceptability  by  the  serial 
processor.12,15  The  parallel  processor 
generates  the  candidates  by  adjusting  the 
probabilities  with  which  words  become 
available  to  the  serial  processor,  in  the 
manner  described  in  the  previous  section. 
Particular  questions  which  arise  here  are 
the  setting  up  of  a  starting  state  for 
the  system,  and  the  feedback  to  the  sys­
tem  from  the  testing  and  emission  of 
candidates. 

The  characteristic  results  of  the 

Bousfield  and  Sedgewick1  experiments  and 
of  the  continued  association  experiments 
are  that  if  the  cumulative  number  of 
responses  given  is  plotted  as  a  function 
of  time  then  the  average  curve  is  well 
described  by  an  equation  of  the  form 
n=c(l-e-mt).  When  the  fine  structure  of 
individual  curves  is  examined,  however, 
one  finds  that  the  responses  occur  in 
bursts,  triggered  by  a  member  of  some 
sub-class,  like  domestic  animals,  etc. 
A  related  phenomenon  occurs  in  the  free 
recall  of  word  l i s ts  where  the  items  show 
a  positional  clustering  even  when  the 
presentation  order  of  the  l i st  is  random.
