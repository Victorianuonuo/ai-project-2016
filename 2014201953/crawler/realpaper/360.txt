(1)  Reliability  is  improved  in  the 

sense  that  the  failure  of  some  components 
of  the  memory  device  does  not  cause  the 
loss  of  the  whole  of  any  entity,  but 
cause  only  inaccuracy  in  recalling. 

(2)  Although  some  uncertainties  ap(cid:173)

pear  in  recalling,  they  are  rather  useful 
for  realizing  an  artificial  intelligence 
with  flexibility  and  applicability.  This 
is  because  a  strictly  logical  comparison, 
for  example,  is  apt  to  discard  useful 
data  which  resembles  certain  other  data. 
The  uncertainty  resulting  from  a  confu(cid:173)
sion  among  similar  data  will  make  the

device  extract  automatically,  from  a  num(cid:173)
ber  of  entities,  the  essence  useful  for 
a  certain  job. 

(3)  Since  information  is  accessed 

associatively  without  sequential  search, 
the  speed  of  access  or  information  re(cid:173)
trieval  is  very  high. 

These  properties  differentiate  infor(cid:173)

mation  processing  using  the  associative 
memory  from  that  of  conventional  com(cid:173)
puters . 

Recently,  the  thinking  process  has 

been  studied  in  detail  using  so-called 
heuristic  programs.  For  example,  the 
learning  program  for  the  game  of 
is  well  known.  The  model  in 
checkers7,8 
this  paper  is  related  to  such  heuristics 
in  game  playing,  general  problem  solving 
and  possibly  to  the  thinking  process  i t(cid:173)
self. 

A  Model  of  Associative  Memory 

A  mode]  of  associative  memory  real(cid:173)

ized  in  the  following  way  is  named  an 
'Assoclatron': 

Presume  that  an  entity  is  represented 

by  a  row  vector 

(1) 

where  X1  =  - 1,  0,  ].  An  entity  is  com(cid:173)
posed  of  several  patterns  and  of  neutral 
areas.  Each  pattern  is  composed  of  - l ' s, 
0's  and  l ' s,  while  the  neutral  area  Is 
composed  only  of  0's.  Each  pattern  has 
a  simple  or  complex  meaning,  and  the  en(cid:173)
t i ty  represents  the  association  of  these 
patterns. 

Now  the  memorizing  process  is  con(cid:173)
sidered.  Let  xr  denote  the  transposed 
vector  of  x.  The  inner  state  of  the 
memory,  after  k  entitles  x(1)  ,  x(2)  ,  . ..  , 
x(k)  have  been  stored,  is  defined  as  an 
n x n matrix 

Suppose  that  it  also  can  be  applied  to  a 
vector  u  =  (uj)  and  a  matrix  A  =  ( ai j),  as 

If  y  is  composed  of  a  neutral  area  and 
a  few  patterns  which  are  also  the  com(cid:173)
ponents  of  a  stored  entity  x,  then  it  is 
possible  that  y  is  nearly  equal  to  x, 
even  when  a  lot  of  entities  are  memorized. 
This  would  enable  recalling  the  whole  of 
a  stored  entity  from  a  part  of  i t.  Con(cid:173)
sequently,  a  few  patterns  previously  pro(cid:173)
cessed  can  be  associated  with  the  rest 
of  the  patterns  of  entity  x. 

Figure  1  depicts  the  behavior  of  the 

Assoclatron  as  a  neural  network.  Any 
pair  of  neurons  xi  and  xj  is  connected 
through  a  memory  unit mij; ,  which  corre(cid:173)
sponds  to  the  synapse.  This  model  dif(cid:173)
fers  from  general  neural  networks  in  the 
following  points, 

(1)  All  neurons  are  mutually  con(cid:173)

nected  . 

s t a t e s . 

(2)  Kach  neuron  has  three  possible 

(3)  For  any  pair  of  neurons,  the 
values  of  synaptic  conductance  are  as(cid:173)
sumed  to  be  equal  for  both  directions. 
The  value  of  the  memory  unit  my  Is  multi(cid:173)
valued  and  Is  modified  during  a  memoriz(cid:173)
ing  process  by  adding  the  product Xi, Xj 
to  the  previous  value.  However,  in  propa(cid:173)
gation  of  a  stimulus,  the  quantized  value 
1 s used . 

(4)  Refractory  time  is  not  con(cid:173)

sidered  . 
From  these  items,  It  can  be  said  that  the 
Assoclatron  Is  at  best  a  considerably 
simplified  model  of  a  neural  network. 
This  simplification  might  cause  a  situ(cid:173)
ation  where  separation  of  patterns  is  not 
very  good,  reversed  patterns  cannot  be 
separated  and  the  direction  of  recall  is 
out  of  control.  The  f i r st  problem  will 
be  solved  by  increasing  neurons,  and  the 
other  problems  by  modifying  the  model. 
But  the  modification  is  not  always  neces(cid:173)
sary,  because  the  results  turn  out  pre(cid:173)
dictably  when  the  model  is  applied  appro(cid:173)
priately. 

In  this  section,  properties  of  memo(cid:173)

rizing  and  recalling  entitles  are  dis(cid:173)
cussed. 
It  was  previously  mentioned 
that  an  entity  is  composed  of  patterns, 
each  of  which  has  a  meaning.  Here  we 
consider  it  in  a  l i t t le  more  detail. 
Figure  2  illustrates  the  relation  of  an 
entity  and  its  component  patterns;  that 
is  Fig.  2  (a)  shows  the  array  of  compo(cid:173)
nents  of  vector  x  and  (b)  shows  an  ex(cid:173)
ample  of  entities.  The  entity  is  com-
posed  of  patterns  1,  2,  3  and  a  neutral 
area,  where,  pattern  1  has  the  meaning  of 
'red',  pattern  2  the  meaning  'spherical', 
etc..  Now  it  is  reasonable  to  consider 
that  a  pattern  or  a  few  patterns

lapped  at VB .  When  this  number  is  arbi(cid:173)
trary,  the  following  argument  w i ll  hold. 
Let  k  pairs  of  Aj  -Bj  be  stored  as 
shown  in  Fig.  3  ( f ).  For  simplicity  of 
calculation,  k  is  presumed  to  be  an  odd 
number.  Besides,  it  is  presumed  that 
(VA)  =  s  is  odd  and  that  the  entities 
are  random  patterns  at  areas  vA  and  vB. 
These  assumptions  do  not  necessarily  hold 
in  actual  use  of  the  associative  memory. 
But  it  matters  l i t t l e,  because  this  only 
causes  a  small  error  in  estimation  of 
accuracy  of  recalling. 
process,  the  probability  that  a  memory 
unit  votes  for  the  right  state  of  a  neu(cid:173)
ron  for  the  specific  entity  stored  in 
the  memory  device  is 

In  any  recalling 

(k  +  l)/2k. 

(20) 

The  probability  that  the  state  of  a  neu(cid:173)
ron  decided  by  majority  is  r i g h t,  is  re(cid:173)
presented  by  the  sum  of  the  f i r st  (s+l)/2 
terms  of  the  binomial  expansion  of 

where  C  ;  is  the  number  of  combination. 
As  this  summation  cannot  be  written  as  a 
simple  form,  to  determine  the  behavior  of 
this  equation,  the  graphical  expression 
is  taken  by  calculating  the  values  of  P 
for  various  values  of  k  and  s.  This  is 
shown  in  Fig.  4.  From  the  graph,  it  is 
found  that  completely  accurate  recalling 
can  be  done  when  the  number  of  stored  en(cid:173)
t i t l es  is  very  small  or  when  the  number 
of  elements  constructing  the  input  pat(cid:173)
tern  is  very  large.  But  it  is  important 
that  the  capability  of  an  associative 
memory  is  not  judged  only  by  the  accuracy 
of  memory.  Characteristics  of  information 
processing  using  an  associative  memory 
are  shown  in  the  following  sections. 

Computer  Simulation  and  Some 

Experimental  Results 

An  Associatron  composed  of  180  neu(cid:173)
rons  has  been  simulated  by  a  d i g i t al  com(cid:173)
puter.  Using  this  simulated  model,  sev(cid:173)
eral  experiments  were  performed.  To 
evaluate  the  results,  the  correlation  co(cid:173)
efficient  between  a  stored  pattern  and 
the  recalled  pattern  is  used.  Presume 
that  both  patterns  A  and  B  consist  of  n 
elements,  and  that  corresponding  elements 
of  patterns  are  a  and  bi,  respectively. 
The  correlation  coefficient  is  defined  as 

(23) 

r  =  1  means  that  A  and  B  are  the  same. 
When  r  equals  zero,  they  are  indifferent, 
and  when  r  equals  - 1,  one  is  the  reversed 
pattern  of  the  other.  Although  input 
patterns  for  recalling  should  also  be 
memorized,  for  convenience  of  evaluation 
of  the  behavior  of  the  memory,  they  are 
not  memorized  in  these  experiments. 

Three  areas  A,  B  and  C, 

Example  1 
each  of  which  consists  of  40  neurons  are 
taken  on  the  neural  plane.  Each  of  the 
names  of  6  things,  3  colors  and  3  shapes 
is  coded  into  a  40  bit  pattern  of  l's  and 
- l ' s.  A  thing,  i ts  color  and  i ts  shape 
are  stored  at  areas  A,  B  and  C,  respec(cid:173)
t i v e l y.  After  6  t r i p l e ts  are  stored,  the 
memory  device  is  made  to  recall  the  color 
and  the  shape  from  a  thing,  and  vice  ver(cid:173)
sa.  The  results  are  shown  in  Fig.  5. 
The  device  recalls  the  color  and  the 
shape  completely  from  the  thing,  but  the 
accuracy  of  reverse  recalling  is  about 
92 %. 

An  experiment  concerning 

Example  2 
simple  concept  formation  was  accomplished. 
In  this  case,  for  example,  red  things  and 
the  word  'red'  such  as  Apple-red-spheri(cid:173)
cal-word ' red ' ,  brick-red-boxlike-word 
'red'  are  shown  one  by  one  to  the  memory 
device.  At  f i r s t,  the  memory  device 
might  take  the  word  'red'  for  'spherical', 
but  as  it  is  trained,  it  forms  the  con(cid:173)
cept  'red'  as  shown  in  Fig.  6,  where  sym(cid:173)
bols  are  used  instead  of  things,  shapes 
colors  etc..  Thus,  the  pattern  of  'red' 
is  associated  with  the  pattern  of  the 
word  ' r e d ',  and  the  memory  device  recalls 
one  from  another.  Besides,  if  entitles 
apple-red  and  apple-spherical  are  stored 
at  other  times,  the  device  recalls  'red' 
and  'spherical'  from  'apple'  and  vice  ver(cid:173)
sa.  That  i s,  although  the  t r i p l et  apple-
red-spherical  is  not  a  stored  entity,  it 
is  formed  in  the  memory  device. 

Example  3 
When  the associative  memory 
device  is  applied  to  games,  a  set  of  pat(cid:173)
terns  effective  for  winning  the  game  is 
expected  to  be  extracted  automatically. 
The  following  game  is  used  for  a  demon(cid:173)
stration  of  the  learning  process  in  the 
associative  memory.  There  are  n  chips  on 
the  board  i n i t i a l l y.  Two  players  take 
any  number  of  one  to  three  chips  alter(cid:173)
nately.  The  player  who  is  forced  to  take 
the  last  chip  loses  the  game.  The  re(cid:173)
striction  is  that  a  player  must  not  take 
the  number  which  his  opponent  took  at  his 
previous  move.  For  simplicity,  presume 
that  there  are  only  six  chips  on  the  i n i(cid:173)
t i al  board.  To  play  the  game  using  the 
Associatron,  f i r st  the  components  of  vec(cid:173)
tor  x  are  assigned  as  shown  in  Fig.  7  to 
four  patterns  of  the  board  position,  the 
move,  the  mutual  effect  of  the  board
