Abstract

We extend traditional Description Logics (DL) with
a simple mechanism to handle approximate concept
deﬁnitions in a qualitative way. Often, for example
in medical applications, concepts are not deﬁnable
in a crisp way but can fairly exhaustively be con-
strained through a particular sub- and a particular
super-concept. We introduce such lower and up-
per approximations based on rough-set semantics,
and show that reasoning in these languages can be
reduced to standard DL satisﬁability. This allows
us to apply Rough Description Logics in a study
of medical trials about sepsis patients, which is a
typical application for precise modeling of vague
knowledge. The study shows that Rough DL-based
reasoning can be done in a realistic use case and
that modeling vague knowledge helps to answer
important questions in the design of clinical trials.

1 Introduction
Many existing knowledge modeling techniques are best
suited for modeling crisp knowledge. In practice, however,
it is not always possible to make clear-cut distinctions. A
modeler frequently has to account for borderline cases. Ap-
proaches that do take such uncertainty or vagueness into ac-
count often do this via some kind of weighting mechanism
or an approach based on fuzzy sets. A drawback of these ap-
proaches is that uncertainty is introduced in the model, which
often has the consequence that no crisp answers can be given
to queries on the model. This paper introduces a complemen-
tary mechanism that allows for modelling of vague knowl-
edge by crisp speciﬁcation of approximations of a concept.

Medicine is a typical domain where concepts cannot al-
ways be described in a crisp manner. E.g., the deﬁnition of a
disease is not always clear-cut, especially if a single marker is
lacking that distinguishes a patient with a disease from a pa-
tient without the disease. This is common in psychiatry and
in diseases in which the underlying pathology of the disease
is unclear. An example of the latter is sepsis. Rough Descrip-
tion Logics (Rough DL) provides us with the possibility to
describe such diseases for which a crisp deﬁnition is lacking.
Rough DL extends classical Description Logic ([Baader
et al., 2003]) by two modal-like operators, called the lower

and upper approximations. In the spirit of Rough Set theory
[Pawlak, 1982], two concepts approximate an underspeciﬁed,
vague, concept as particular sub- and super-concepts, describ-
ing which elements are deﬁnitely, respectively possibly, el-
ements of the concept. The following picture illustrates the
general idea:

Septic

Septic

Septic

Each square denotes a set of domain elements, which can-
not further be discerned by any available criterion. Then, the
circled line denotes the set of septic patients, i.e., the vague
concept which we are incapable to formally deﬁne. If we cap-
ture this lack of criteria to discern between two objects as a
indiscernibility relation dis∼, we can formally deﬁne the up-
per approximation as the set of patients that are indiscernible
from at least one septic patient.
Septic ≡ {pat1 | ∃ pat2: dis∼(pat1,pat2) & pat2 ∈ Septic}.

Similarly, we can deﬁne the lower approximation as the set
of patients containing all, and only those patients, for which
it is known that all indiscernible patients must be septic.
Septic ≡{pat1 | ∀ pat2: dis∼(pat1,pat2) → pat2 ∈ Septic}

In our picture, the upper approximation is depicted as the
union of the dark squares (the lower approximation), and the
gray squares, the boundary. This semantics can be transferred
to Rough DL approximations in a straightforward way: the
patients in the concept Septic are the deﬁnitely septic pa-

tients, those that are unmistakably septic, the concept Septic
models the possibly septic patients, as opposed to the white
squares, which model deﬁnitely not septic patients. These
approximations are to be deﬁned in a crisp way.

Technically, Rough DL are very simple languages, as they
can be simulated with traditional DL without added expres-
siveness. This means that reasoning can be performed by
translation, and subsequent use of a common DL reasoner.
We consider it a big advantage of our approach that we can
use an optimised DL reasoner without having to develop new
ad-hoc decision procedures and implementations.
In other
words, our Rough DL’s are strictly speaking not more expres-
sive than traditional DL’s, but the notions that we introduce

are useful modeling devices for speciﬁc types of knowledge
(namely non-crisp concepts).

Our current research was motivated by a recent study of the
deﬁnitions for sepsis used in clinical trials. Before a medical
treatment can be used in daily clinical practice, its effect and
impact on the patient have to be investigated in a clinical trial.
When several trials have been performed it is interesting to
compare the results of those trials. Unfortunately, the nine
different trials that were investigated in [Peelen et al., 2005]
showed too much variation in their deﬁnitions of severe sepsis
patients to enable a fair comparison of trial results.

We show how to use Rough DL to formalise and compare
sepsis deﬁnitions used in different trials. Describing sepsis
through approximations enforces powerful semantic conse-
quences. Rough DL turns out to be an appropriate logical
representation language to model vague concepts and provide
crisp answers to queries, and can thereby assist in the valida-
tion of existing and, ultimately, the construction of new trials.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. First,
we introduce our use-case, the medical condition sepsis. In
Section 3, Rough DL is deﬁned as an extension to standard
DL for modeling vague knowledge. We give some logical
consequences of the semantics of the extension, and explain
how reasoning can be done by reducing Rough DL to stan-
dard DL reasoning. In Section 4, we use Rough DL to model
deﬁnitions of severe sepsis used in different clinical trials.
Based on real patient data we evaluate the design of the trials.

2 Sepsis: a condition with a vague deﬁnition

Severe sepsis is our example for vague information through-
out the paper. Therefore, we will brieﬂy provide some medi-
cal background. Sepsis is a disease in which the immune sys-
tem of the patient overreacts to an infection. Due to this reac-
tion the patient becomes severely ill, which easily results in
organ failure and eventually death. The cause and underlying
cellular pathways of this disease are unclear, which hinders
the precise characterization of the sepsis patient. Therefore,
a consensus deﬁnition of sepsis was established in 1992 to
deﬁne several stages of sepsis [Bone, R.C., 1992]. This deﬁ-
nition does not provide a precise deﬁnition of sepsis, but gives
the criteria for which there was a consensus that they should
at least hold for a patient with severe sepsis. In this paper
we focus on the patients with severe sepsis, but for brevity
we will refer to these patients as septic. The consensus state-
ment deﬁnes patients with severe sepsis as ‘patients having
a conﬁrmed infection with at least two out of four Systemic
Inﬂammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria:

• temperature >38◦C OR temperature <36◦C
• respiratory rate >20 breaths/min OR PaCO2<32 mmHg
• heart rate >90 beats/minute
• leucocyte count <4,000 mm3 OR >12,000 mm3

and organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion, or hypotension. From
now on we refer to these criteria as the Bone criteria.

Patients who have this combination of symptoms may have
sepsis, however, this is not necessarily the case. We refer to
these patients as being possibly septic. On the other hand, we
can deﬁne a group of patients that are septic for sure, namely

those who fulﬁll the Bone criteria and have severe multiple
organ failure. We will refer to these patients as the deﬁnitely
septic patients and deﬁne them as fulﬁlling the strict criteria:
the Bone criteria plus at least three of the following symptoms
of organ failure:

• pH ≤ 7.30
• thrombocyte count < 80,000 mm3
• urine output < 0.5 ml/kg body weight/hour (provided the pa-

tient is not on chronic dialysis),

• PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 250, and
• systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg OR vaso-active medication.

3 Rough DL for vague knowledge
We now present a conservative extension of Description Log-
ics (DLs), i.e. an extension which improves the modeling
capacities without changing the expressive power of the lan-
guage. More concretely, we will introduce two modal-like
operators (·) and (·) for lower and upper approximations to
describe elements which either belong deﬁnitively or possi-
bly to the concepts under its scope. These operators introduce
a notion of approximation without effectively increasing the
expressiveness of the language. Thus, we get extra modeling
facilities for free, without having to develop new calculi, and
without paying an extra price in computational complexity.

3.1 Description Logics
Description Logics (DL) are a well-studied family of set-
description languages which usually come with (some or
all) Boolean operators and limited quantiﬁcation, and which
can be extended with additional functionality in a modular
way. This way properties on relations (such as symmetry,
transitivity or inclusion hierarchies), number restrictions, or
even some form of data-types (Concrete Domains) are of-
ten included. Description Logics have a well-deﬁned model-
theoretic semantics, and the last two decades the computa-
tional properties of a wide variety of DLs has been studied.

Formally, we introduce the DL ALC, which is sufﬁcient
to model our case-study. The general deﬁnition of approxi-
mations, however, will be independent of any particular DL.
ALC is a simple DL with conjunction C (cid:7) D, disjunction
C (cid:8) D, negation ¬C and universal ∀r.C and existential quan-
tiﬁcation ∃r.C. The semantics is given as follows:
Def. 1 Let I = (U, ·I ) be an interpretation, where U is a
universe, and ·I
a function mapping concept names to subsets
and role names to relations over U . It extends to the Boolean
operators as usual and to the quantiﬁer as follows:

• (∃R.C)I = {i ∈ U | ∃j ∈ U : (i, j) ∈ RI & j ∈ C I }

• (∀R.C)I = {i ∈ U | ∀j ∈ U : (i, j) ∈ RI → j ∈ C I }
In a terminology T (called TBox) the interpretations of
concepts can be restricted to the models of T by axioms of the
form C (cid:9) D or C ˙=D. Based on this model-theoretic seman-
tics, concepts can be checked for unsatisﬁability: whether
they are necessarily interpreted as the empty set. Another
useful semantic implication is subsumption of two concepts
C and D (a subset relation of C I and DI w.r.t. all models I
of T ) denoted by T |= C (cid:9) D.

IJCAI-07

A knowledge base Σ = (T , A) extends a TBox T with
an assertional component (usually called ABox) A, which is
a set of assertions i : C and R(i, j) for individual names i, j,
a relation R and a concept C. The semantics is a straightfor-
ward extention of the previous deﬁnition: an interpretation
I is a model for a assertions i : C and R(i, j) if, and only,
iI ∈ C I and RI(iI, jI ). Then, a knowledge base is consis-
tent, if there is a model for both its TBox and ABox.

3.2 Rough Description Logics

Description Logics are suitable for modeling crisp knowledge
but are often too rigid for approximate information. For ex-
ample, no explicit mechanism is in place when a deﬁnition is
not commonly agreed upon, or when exceptions need to be
captured. The sepsis use-case provides an example for such
vaguely deﬁned classes, for which no agreed upon criteria
exist to determine whether a patient is indeed septic or not.

The basic idea is rather straightforward: even though we
fail to formally deﬁne the class of septic patients, we can ap-
proximate it by giving an upper and a lower bound. The upper
approximation of the set of septic patients is formed by the set
of patients that fulﬁll the Bone criteria, i.e. the possibly septic
patients. Orthogonally, the lower approximation of the set of
septic patients is the set of patients that are deﬁnitely septic,
i.e. the patients that fulﬁll the strict criteria.

Traditionally, in DLs this is modeled using primitive deﬁ-
nitions, i.e. axioms of the form C (cid:9) D, where C is restricted
by D without being fully deﬁned. The relation between the
concept Septic and its approximations is in the pure DL mod-
eling just Deﬁnitely Septic (cid:9) Septic (cid:9) Possibly Septic.

Rough DL: Approximations, Syntax and Semantics
Modelling vague concepts with the traditional approach has
its limits when the vague concept of Septic patients needs to
be deﬁned. Let us consider a special type of sepsis where the
renal system fails. In DL terms, the relation between renal
sepsis and sepsis would be modeled by an axiom RenalSep-
tic (cid:9) Septic. Again, renal sepsis is not deﬁnable in a crisp
way, but there could be an approximation describing patients
which have possibly renal sepsis. Now, the question arises
whether possibly renal septic patients should be possibly sep-
tic, i.e. whether Possibly RenalSeptic (cid:9) Possibly Septic or
not. In traditional DL it is possible to have all typical prop-
erties of the renal sepsis, but not the typical properties of a
sepsis. What is missing is automatic inheritance of the ap-
proximations in a monotonic way.

In our motivating picture there should be subsumption re-
lations at the “???” positions, i.e. that Deﬁnitely RenalSeptic
(cid:9) Deﬁnitely Septic and Possibly RenalSeptic (cid:9) Possi-
bly Septic should be a logical consequence of the knowledge

base. In this sense, DL is inappropriate to model vague infor-
mation, as there is a stronger semantic relations underlying
the approximations of a concept. With Rough Description
Logics (Rough DL), which we are about to introduce, we at-
tempt to close this gap in a conceptually simple way.

Before providing formal semantics it is worth pointing out
that approximations have very distinct properties. The upper
approximation is the set of patients with a strong indication
that they might be septic. Formally, this means that for every
patient pat1 in Possibly Septic, there must be at least one sep-
tic patient pat2, for which there are no criteria to explain why
pat2 differs from pat1, i.e. pat1 is indiscernible from pat2.

Rough DL is not restricted to a particular DL, and will be

deﬁned for an arbitrary Description Logic DL.
Def. 2 The language RDL of Rough DL is the smallest set
of concepts containing DL, and for every concept C ∈ RDL
also the upper approximation C ∈ RDL and the lower ap-
proximation C ∈ RDL.

The notions of rough T- and ABox, as well as rough knowl-
edge base extend the usual notions in the expected way.
Def. 3 Let a rough interpretation be a triple I = (U, R∼, ·I),
where U is a universe, ·I
an interpretation function, and R∼
an equivalence relation over U . The function ·I
maps RDL
concepts to subsets and role names to relations over the do-
main U . It extends to the new constructs as follows:
• (C)I = {i ∈ U | ∃j ∈ U : (i, j) ∈ R∼ & j ∈ C I }

• (C)I = {i ∈ U | ∀j ∈ U : (i, j) ∈ R∼ → j ∈ C I }
Intuitively, the upper approximation of a concept C cov-
ers the elements of a domain with the typical properties of
C, whereas the lower approximation contains the prototypi-
cal elements of C.

What did we gain? Even if it is impossible to formally
deﬁne a concept, such as Septic, we can often specify the ap-
proximations. In our use-case, the upper approximation can
be deﬁned using the “Bone criteria”, the lower approxima-
tion, using the set of “Strict criteria” described in Section 2.
In Rough DL we now model vague knowledge in a precise
way; with explicit formal semantics.

Some logical consequences of the semantics Consider a
simplistic Rough DL terminology, which models sepsis by
its approximations. Concretely, having an infection is a cer-
tain property of possibly septic patients , i.e. the upper ap-
proximation Septic is a subconcept of Inf. Also, septic pa-
tients must have an organ failure (OF) in at least one organ
system. Furthermore, deﬁnitely septic patients must have
multiple organ failure. This gives the following terminology:
T ={Septic ˙= Bone, Septic ˙= Strict, Septic (cid:9)Inf, Septic(cid:9)
OF, Septic (cid:9)MOF} With the implicit semantics of RDL
there are logical consequences, some of which we will dis-
cuss in more detail.

• Possibly septic patients must be deﬁnitely infected. In
logical terms, we have T |= Septic (cid:9) Inf. Why is this
the case? Take a patient pat with all the typical proper-
ties of sepsis, including an infection. Assume that he has
an atypical infection, i.e., that there is a similar patient

IJCAI-07

559

pat2 without an infection. But pat being typically sep-
tic means that there must be a septic patient pat3 similar
to pat, to which pat2 is also similar because of transi-
tivity. Then pat2 is similar to a septic patient, and must
belong to the upper approximation Septic. By this he
must have all the typical properties of sepsis, including
an infection, which is a contradiction.

• Possibly septic patients must have possible organ fail-
ure. Formally, we can conclude that T |= Septic (cid:9) OF.
This means that if we know that organ failure is part of
the proper deﬁnition of sepsis, patients that are possibly
septic must at least have some condition that resembles
organ failure. A similar result holds for the lower ap-
proximation Septic and multiple organ failure.
The following ﬁgure shows the taxonomy of axioms
based on the subsumption hierarchy w.r.t. the rough DL
semantics, where the relations with the boldly printed
concepts are implicitly derived.

Septic ≡Strict

There are more examples of the intrinsic semantics of
Rough DLs, which do not show in the previous ﬁgure.

• There are no deﬁnitely non-typical sepsis patients. Sup-
pose that we deﬁne non-typical sepsis patients (NTS) as
those septic patients which are not deﬁnitely septic, i.e.,
patients for which a similar patient exists which is not
diagnosed as septic. Formally, we add an axiom NTS (cid:9)
Septic (cid:7)¬Sepsis to T to get a new TBox T (cid:4). Rough DL
semantics implies that there can be no deﬁnitely non-
typical septic patients, i.e. that T (cid:4) |= NTS = ⊥.

• Deﬁnitively septic or deﬁnitively not septic. Suppose
that for a new trial only patients are selected which are
deﬁnitively only diagnosed as either deﬁnitively septic,
or deﬁnitively not septic, i.e., ∀ diag.(Septic (cid:8) ¬Septic).
Then, every patient who is diagnosed as possibly sep-
tic, ∃diag.Septic, must possibly have been diagnosed as
deﬁnitively septic (or ∃ diag.Septic).

• Finally, it is a simple consequence of the semantics that
approximations of approximations are equivalent to the
approximations themselves, e.g., that Septic ≡ Septic.

Reasoning with Rough DLs One of the main advantages
of our newly introduced modeling mechanism is that reason-
ing almost comes for free. As opposed to most other mech-
anisms to deal with vague knowledge in DL, reasoning with
approximations can be reduced to standard DL reasoning, by
translating rough concepts into pure DL concepts with a spe-
cial reﬂexive, transitive and symmetric role.

}.

Let C be a rough concept. We deﬁne a translation func-
: RDL → DL for concepts with At = A
tion (·)t
for atomic concepts A, and (C)t = ∃r∼.C, and (C)t =
∀r∼.C for C ∈ RDL where r∼ is a new role sym-
bol, and where the translation function is inductively ap-
plied on subconcepts for all other constructs. This deﬁ-
nition can be extended to axioms (C (cid:9) D)t = C t (cid:9)
Dt and TBoxes T = {ax1, . . . , axn} as follows: T t =
{ref l(r∼), sym(r∼), trans(r∼), axt

, . . . , axt

For any DL DL with universal and existential quantiﬁca-
tion, and symmetric, transitive and reﬂexive roles, there is no
increase in expressive power, i.e. Rough DL can be simulated
in (almost) standard DL.
Prop. 1 Let RDL be the rough extension of a Description
Logic DL, T an RDL TBox, and (·)t the above given trans-
lation. An RDL concept C is satisﬁable in a rough interpre-
tation w.r.t. T iff C is DL-satisﬁable w.r.t. T t. Formally:
T |= C = ⊥ iff T t |= C t = ⊥.
The proof is by contradiction: assume that T |= C = ⊥ in
Rough DL, but that there is a DL model I = (U, (·)I ) of T t
such that (C t)I (cid:11)= ∅. It follows from the construction of the
translation function (·)t that I (cid:4) = (U, r∼, (·)I (cid:2)) is a model
for T , and that C I (cid:2) (cid:11)= ∅, which is a contradiction. The other
direction is similar.

As with usual DLs, one can reduce other reasoning ser-
vices, such as subsumption, to satisﬁability (and ﬁnally to
ABox consistency) in the presence of negation. Rough DL
are no different. As the translation is linear, the complexity
of reasoning in Rough DL is the same as of reasoning in its
carrier DL with quantiﬁers, symmetry and transitivity.

4 Modeling Clinical trials with Rough DL

Clinical trials use entry criteria to select patients for the study.
The choice of these criteria is an important step in clinical
trial design: to be able to compare the results of the trial with
those of other trials and to assess the generalizability of the
results to daily clinical practice, the entry criteria have to be
compatible with deﬁnitions used in comparable trials and the
agreed standard deﬁnitions of disease. This is obviously com-
plicated when no crisp disease deﬁnition exists.

In the case of severe sepsis, nine recent randomized clini-
cal trials all used different entry criteria to select patients with
severe sepsis [Peelen et al., 2005]. Seven out of the nine in-
vestigated trials used a structure similar to the original con-
sensus deﬁnition for severe sepsis: conﬁrmed infection plus
SIRS criteria plus organ failure. However, the number of re-
quired SIRS criteria varied between the trials and some trials
used a slight modiﬁcation of the original SIRS criteria. Fur-
thermore, the speciﬁcation of organ failure and the required
number of failing organ systems differed.

One way to investigate the differences in entry criteria is to
compare the deﬁnitions used in the trials with the approxima-
tions of the medical condition. In our study, we use the con-
cepts Strict and Bone as approximations of sepsis and com-
pare them to the entry criteria used in the nine trials. There
are four interesting situations. Are there patients that are

1. in one of the trials but not in Bone?

IJCAI-07

560

2. in all trials but not in Strict?

3. in Bone but not in one of the trials?

4. in Strict but not in all trials?

The existence of such patients would signal a discrepancy
between the trial deﬁnitions and the interpretation of sepsis,
pointing to potential ﬂaws in the set-up of the trials. With
RDL a validation of these ﬂaws comes for free as it allows
the user to model their assumptions about the inherent vague-
ness of the deﬁnitions in a precise way. We will now describe
how we used RDL to perform such an investigation.

In order to use RDL for patient selection we ﬁrst trans-
lated the deﬁnition for each trial into a DL formula. We did
the same for the Bone deﬁnition and the Strict deﬁnition of
sepsis, thus building a TBox with 11 deﬁnitions for septic pa-
tients. In addition we have translated a dataset from the Dutch
National Intensive Care Evaluation (NICE) registry contain-
ing information on 71,929 patients into an ABox, using the
terminology from the TBox. With the selection criteria for the
different trials and the translated data, we used a DL-reasoner
(Racer [Haarslev and M¨oller, 2001]) to select the patients that
would be eligible for the different trials (thereby mimicking
the patient selection process). The following table shows the
numbers of patients of 4 of the 9 trials:

To answer

the aforementioned questions, we deﬁne
Sepsis ≡ Bone and Sepsis ≡ Strict in our RDL terminol-
ogy, as those are the most widely accepted upper and lower
approximations of Sepsis. Additionally, we can model the re-
lation of the trials to the concept Sepsis explicitly. Although
the 9 different trials widely cover different ways of describ-
ing possibly septic patients, it might be conceivable that there
are patients outside the scope of all of these trials. However,
one could assume that the 9 trials cover the most typical of
all possible sepsis patients. Because RDL provides formal
representations for the intuitions ‘most typical’ and ‘all possi-
ble’, we can model this assumption in a formal way. Namely,
the union of all trials is equivalent to the lower approximation
(i.e. the typical cases) of the upper approximation (i.e. all pos-
sible cases) of Sepsis. Similarly, we can model the assump-
tion that the intersection of all trials covers the most typical
patients that are deﬁnitively septic. This is done by deﬁning
the intersection of all trial concepts to be a lower approxima-
tion (i.e. the most typical cases) of the lower approximation
(i.e. the deﬁnitively septic patients) of the concept Sepsis.

Given our experimental setup it is easy to show that there
are serious ﬂaws in the trial selection. It is a consequence of
the semantics of RDL that an approximation itself can not be
approximated. This implies that Bone ≡ UnionOfTrials and
Strict ≡ IntersectionOfTrials. This resulted in inconsistency
of the deﬁnitions with respect to the trial data.

Using our infrastructure one can now perform a more de-
tailed data-based validation to detect the source of the logi-
cal contradiction. For example, we queried for patients with
queries like ¬Bone (cid:7) trial-X to look for violations of the up-

per approximation and queries like Strict (cid:7) ¬trial-X for vi-
olations of the lower approximation. In this way, we found
141 patients in PROWESS-sepsis and 6 patients in Lexipafant-
sepsis that do not fulﬁll the Bone criteria.

Finally, we can use purely terminological reasoning to
analyse the trial criteria. For example, classifying all deﬁ-
nitions brought to light that none of the concepts describing
the trials is subsumed by Bone. This is an interesting result
when compared to the data-based validation. Although for 7
of the trial deﬁnitions we did not ﬁnd any patient that violated
the upper approximation, such patients can exist in principle.
Similarly, with respect to the lower approximation, we found
that only 4 of the trial deﬁnitions subsumed Strict.

Advantage over standard DL Trial validation using a
standard DL infrastructure without the rough extension is al-
ready a signiﬁcant improvement over the current situation,
in which patient selection is procedurally performed as a se-
quence of database queries. Using standard DL we can check
violations, as discussed above, with A-box reasoning over the
data set and the terminology, or purely terminologically, as
suggested in the previous two paragraphs (which are not nec-
essarily restricted to RDL).

Modeling the deﬁnitions in RDL gives an additional im-
provement: the validation against the criteria is done auto-
matically. There is a way of achieving the same validation
with pure DL, which we is much less elegant, though. Here,
one would sequentially check the validation criteria 1 to 4
introduced above, i.e. by checking satisﬁability of the con-
cept ¬Bone (cid:7) trial-X for all trials. However, this amounts to
a procedural veriﬁcation of the assumptions about the vague
deﬁnitions about Sepsis, which is error-prone, and tedious.

Moreover, our RDL model excludes the invalid deﬁnitions
automatically. For example, the set of patients in Lexipafant-
sepsis (cid:7) ¬Bone is empty per deﬁnition. To achieve the same
result in a pure DL TBox one has to model the relation be-
tween trials and Bone explicitly, e.g. by asserting UnionOf-
Trials ≡ Bone. But this is an incorrect oversimpliﬁcation of
the relation between the trials and the approximation of Sepsis
as opposed to the much more accurate RDL formalisation.

5 Related and future work

The work described in this paper covers a wide variety of
topics that have been studied extensively in the literature.
This means that there are a plethora of similar approaches,
to which we will brieﬂy refer.

• Rough DL versus Modal DL. From a technical perspec-
tive, Rough DL is a fusion of DL with modal S5.1 Most
attempts to introduce modal operators into DL focus on
unions or produces, which usually requires more com-
plex, mostly Kripke-based, semantics (e.g., [Baader and
Laux, 1995]) and new decision procedures. Our modali-
ties range over the domain itself rather than over varying

1Fusion means, that the different operators of the two languages
apply on different sets of roles, and don’t interfere [Baader et al.,
2002]. This makes fusions behave better than their more complex
relatives unions or products [Gabbay et al., 2003].

cidability and complexity results come for free, and we
can apply existing reasoners.

• Rough DL versus Fuzzy DL. Fuzzy DLs have recently
got increasing attention, particularly starting with the
work of Straccia [Straccia, 2001]. Vagueness of con-
cepts is expressed as a degree of membership. Rough
DL advocate a simpler and qualitative approach, which
is appropriate for some domains, such as the medical.
In our case study, e.g., there is no way of quantifying
membership of the class Septic, but well-deﬁned upper
and lower approximations. Note, for example, that the
Bone criteria are deﬁne in a crisp, non-fuzzy way.

• Rough DL versus Rough Sets. The connection between
Rough Set theory and modal logic is well-established
[D¨untsch, 1997], and there have been previous attempts
to introduce concept languages to model approximations
[Orlowska, 1988]. Orlowska’s work, which is closed
to our own, is restricted to propositional logic and is,
to the best of our knowledge, neither implemented nor
practically applied and evaluated. An interesting or-
thogonal approach in [Doherty et al., 2003] where con-
cepts are deﬁned as pairs of approximations. However,
their semantics is non-standard, and approximate con-
cepts cannot as easily be integrated in standard ontology
languages as with Rough DL.

• Rough DL versus Defaults. Rough DL can also be useful
to model defaults as one can use lower approximations
to capture exceptions in an intuitive way. Simply speak-
ing, the lower approximation then contains the typical
subset of the elements of a concept. Further discussion
of this idea is out of the scope of this paper.

Extension and alternative deﬁnitions The restriction of
the semantics to equivalence relations goes back to Pawlak’s
work [Pawlak, 1982]. To model vague concepts, one might
also study approximation operators based on tolerance rela-
tions (reﬂective and symmetric). Also one could think of sets
of equivalence classes according to different similarity rela-
tions. An interesting extension to graded rough modalities,
as suggested in [Yao and Lin, 1996] is easily integrated into
Rough DL, as they can be translated into number restrictions.
Before extending the language, the more pressing issue of
efﬁciency of the reasoning has to be solved. So is Racer, our
current DL reasoner, not optimised for reasoning with equiv-
alence classes, which makes reasoning sometimes inefﬁcient.
A different path for future research is the explicit integra-
tion of equivalence relations into Rough DL ABoxes. Often,
data can be classiﬁed into indiscernible clusters.
In a ﬁrst
step, Rough DL can be a suitable query language, but it is
also conceivable to learn Rough DL concepts from the ex-
plicit deﬁnitions of the instances of particular concepts.

6 Conclusions
Rough DL, the extension to standard DLs that we introduce
in this paper, allows for precise modeling of vague knowl-
edge. Modeling vague knowledge is a common need in re-
alistic domains, e.g. in medicine. An advantage of modeling

concept approximations in a qualitative way is that queries to
the model give crisp answers. We have shown that reasoning
in RDL can be reduced to standard DL satisﬁability, which
gives us access to reasoning infrastructure.

In our evaluation of medical trials about sepsis patients we
have shown that modeling vague knowledge can help to an-
swer important questions in the design of clinical trials. The
validation of trials based on their formal deﬁnitions is an im-
provement over the usual data-based validation. When the
validation declaratively is done using Rough DL, the logi-
cal consequences of the semantics immediately reveals in-
consistencies in the trial deﬁnitions, whereas several succes-
sive queries are necessary to do the same with standard DLs.
Finally, we claim that Rough DL can be very useful when
building new trials with vaguely deﬁned medical conditions,
as they enforce better models for the selection of patients.
