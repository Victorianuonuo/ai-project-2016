At  the  Stanford  Research  I n s t i t u te  we  are  im(cid:173)
for  the  experimental  study  of

equipment.

(1)  Problem-Solving 

A  robot  system  accomplishes  the  tasks  given  it 
by  performing  a  sequence  of  p r i m i t i ve  actions,  such 
as  wheel  motions  and  camera  readings.  For  e f f i(cid:173)
ciency,  a  task  should  f i r st  be  analyzed  i n to  a 
sequence  of  p r i m i t i ve  actions  calculated  to  have 
the  desired  e f f e c t.  This  process  of  task  analysis 
is  often  called  planning,  because 
plished  before  the  robot  begins  to  act.  Obviously, 
in  order  to  plan,  a  robot  system  must  "know"  about 
the  effects  of
