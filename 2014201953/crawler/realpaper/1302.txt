Introduction 

The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  describe  the

made. 
It  is  intended  to  assist  other  w o r k e rs  in 
A r t i f i c i al  Intelligence  (AI)  who  need  to  develop  m a(cid:173)
nipulators  for  their  own  use.  A  discussion  is  p r e s e n(cid:173)
ted  of  the  constraints  and  requirements  imposed  on 
the  manipulator  which  led  to  the  basic  design,  which 
was  developed  by  Stanford  U n i v e r s i t y 's  A r t i f i c i al 
Intelligence  P r o j e c t.  F u r t h e r,  detail  is  presented 
on  the  implementation  of  the  basic  configuration. 
The  end  result  is  a  manipulator  which  reproduces 
the  f l e x i b i l i ty  and  speed  of  a  human  a r m. 

The  manipulator  is  designed  to  be  integrated 

w i th  a  vehicle  and  is  completely  computer  controlled. 
Human  commands  are  injected  only  at  the  gross 
i n s t r u c t i on  l e v e l,  w i th  a  digital  computer  generating 
the  control  level  commands. 
The  J PL  requirements 
are  for  the  manipulator  to  pick  up  i r r e g u l ar  objects 
f r om  the  laboratory  w o r k i ng  area,  or  surface,  and 
move  them  to  an  a r b i t r a ry  position  either  on  or  off 
the  v e h i c l e,  while  avoiding  any  obstacles. 

The  manipulator  ( F i g.  1)  has  6  degrees  of 

freedom  which  allow  the  grasping  device  (hand)  to  be 
placed  in  any  a r b i t r a ry  position  with  great  f l e x i b i l i t y. 
The  joints  f r om  the  base  to  the  hand  consist  of  two 
r o t a ry  j o i n t s,  one  linear  joint  and  three  r o t a ry 
joints  (2R,  1L,  3R  using  the  nomenclature  of  Ref.  1). 
This  allows  the  human  waist,  shoulder,  a rm  and 
w r i st  motions  to  be  reproduced. 

M a n i p u l a t or  reach  is  a  m a x i m um  of  52"  and  an 
object  of  about  5  pounds  may  be  l i f t e d.  The  m a n i p-  . 
ulator  may  reach  an  object  in  any  part  of  a  sphere 
that  is  not  occupied  ( i.  e.  ,  by  the  vehicle, 
e t c . ).  System  response  allows  a  m a x i m um  motion 
to  be  accomplished  in  about  5  seconds.

The  Jet  Propulsion  Laboratory  is  conducting  a 
robot  research  p r o g r am  w i th  the  end  goal  of  allowing 
planetary  exploration  to  be  conducted  w i th  m i n i m al 
human  supervision.  A  m i s s i on  using  a  mobile  robot 
exploring  the  surface  of  M a rs  has  been  selected  as 
a  local  point  for  equipment  development  and  e x p e r i(cid:173)

It  is  felt  that  a  system  of  this  type  would

ploration;  telecommunication  times  prevent  a  t e l e-
operator  system  f r om  being  used  efficienily,  but  man 
s t i ll  needs  to  exert  supervision  over  the  robot's 
activity. 

The  breadboard  robut  being  assembled  ( F i g.  2) 

w i ll  consist  of  a  n o n - r e a l - t i me  computer,  a  real-
time  control  computer  and  a  vehicle  with  a  m a n i p(cid:173)
ulator  and  imaging  system.  The  intent  of  the  b r e a d(cid:173)
board  is  to  provide  an  actual  demonstration  of  the 
robotic  capability  being  developed. 

The  i n i t i al  tasks  selected  for  the  robot  are 

simple  and  depend  on  man  setting  the  goal.  These 
tasks  are  intended  to  demonstrate  that  a  m i n i m al 
capability  has  been  achieved,  P r i m a r i ly  they  include 
the  vehicle  moving  f r om  one  point  to  another, 
avoiding  obstacles;  and  for  the  manipulator  to  grasp 
an  object  on  the  ground,  hold  it  up  for  inspection  and 
place  it  on  the  vehicle  or  elsewhere. 
This  sequence 
is  to  be  c a r r i ed  out  automatically,  w i th  the  human 
operator  intervening  only  in  the  event  of  problems. 

An  additional  constraint  on  the  J PL  p r o g r am 
was  designed  to  make  m a x i m um  use  of  existing  sys(cid:173)
tems.  The  benefits  of  this  are  obvious:  both  devel(cid:173)

others  can  be  applied. 

Thus,  an  investigation  was  made  to  determine 
if  a  suitable  manipulator  existed.  The  manipulator 
requirements  were:  a  good  interface  with  a  digital 
computer, 
the  ability  to  be  integrated  w i th  a  vehicle 
and  to  w o rk  f r om  the  vehicle, 
and  light  weight,

However,  since  the  basic  J PL  requirements  were 
met, 

redesign  was  kept  to  a  m i n i m u m. 

System  Design 

Two  factors  which  are  basic  to  any  manipulator 
design  are  the  kinematic  configuration  and  the  drive 
power  for  each  link. 
The  J PL  manipulator  must  be 
able  to  w o rk  in  a  non-repetitive  fashion  in  the  angular 
volume  defined  by  appi-oximately  75%  of  a  sphere.

this  requires  that  the  hand  have  a  f u ll

In  order  to  reduce  m e(cid:173)

Ref.  1  describes  a  configuration  which  gives  a 
simple  solution  for  the  joint  positions  versus  the  hand 
position.  This  solution  is  for  a  s i x - d e g r e e - o f-
f r e e d om  manipulator  which  has  three  revolute  joints 
whose  axes  intersect  at  a  point.  Since  a  simple 
analytic  solution  for  the  desired  manipulator  motion 
m i n i m i z es  the  required  computer  calculations  and 
allows  a  smooth  t r a j e c t o ry  to  be  developed  for  each 
link  m o t i o n, 

this  configuration  was  implemented. 

The  next  step  was  to  select  the  type  and  a r r a n g e(cid:173)

ment  of  the  remaining  joint  v a r i a b l e s.  The  p r i m a ry 
choices  were  between  an  anthropomorphic  type  m a(cid:173)
nipulator,  w i th  all  r o t a ry  j o i n t s,  or  a  " m e c h a n i c a l" 
type  manipulator  which  replaces  the  human  elbow 
w i th  a  linear  joint.  Both  configurations  have  a  v e r t i(cid:173)
cal  and  horizontal  degree  of  freedom  at  the  base. 
The  difference  in  the  two  designs  is  in  the  method  by 
which  reach  is  provided.  The  humanoid  manipulator 
provides  a  r o t a ry  joint  in  the  center  of  the  " a r m" 
(an  "elbow")  while  the  mechanical  manipulator  p r o(cid:173)
vides  a  sliding  joint  at  the  shoulder,  giving  a  one-
piece  a r m.  The  humanoid  version  does  not  have  a 
boom  p r o t r u d i ng  f r om  the  back  for  c l o s e - in  w o rk  and 
offers  m o re  f l e x i b i l i ty  in  operation. 
The  linear  joint 
allows  a  m o re  r i g id  assembly  and  provides  a  lighter 
a rm  since  the  linear  mechanism  requires  only  one 
high  torque  joint,  which  is  housed  in  the  shoulder  and 
does  not  contribute  to  gravity  torques.  The  r o t a ry 
elbow  joint  on  the  other  hand  requires  a  high  torque 
joint  which  is  capable  of  producing  at  least  t w o - t h i r ds 
of  the  torque  that  the  shoulder  joint  develops.

superseded  by  DC  m o t o r s.  This  is  due  to  the  fact

Detail  Design 

The  m a in  manipulator  dimensions  (height  of  the

established  vehicle  dimensions  and  desired  set  of

tions  were  to  make  the  reach  long  enough  to  reach 
the  ground,  yet  keep  the  boom  short  enough  to  avoid 
obstacles  on  the  vehicle  (wheels,  drive  m o t o r s, 
other  subsystems,  e t c . ).  Once  the  height  of  the 
shoulder  and  the  m a x i m um  reach  of  the  boom  were 
set  and  the  components  selected,  packaging  and

The  total  m a x i m um  reach  is  52  inches.  The  m a x i(cid:173)

P r i n t ed  c i r c u it  motors  were  selected  for  the 
f i r st  two  link  d r i v e s,  unhoused  motors  for  the  next 
three  links  and  s m a ll  housed  m o t o rs  for  the  last  link 
and  hand.  A ll  were  28  Vdc  m o t o r s. 

F or  the  f i r st  two  joints  p r i me  considerations 

are  high  torque  and  smooth  operation  (low  "cogging" 
or  variance  of  torque  with  angular  position).  The 
m o t o rs  selected  offer  high  torque  capability  at  a 
reasonable  size.  Since  the  manipulator  duty  cycle 
is  low  (1-10%)  average  power  is  not  i m p o r t a nt  but 
peak  power  i s. 
In  addition,  most  link  t r a j e c t o r i es 
used  w i th  the  manipulator  require  acceleration  to  be 
a  linear  function  of  time  w i th  zero  torque  at  the  start 
and  f i n i sh  of  each  t r a j e c t o r y.  T h e r e f o r e,  s t a ll  torque 
(torque  at  zero  speed)  is  only  needed  for  gravity 
torques.  This  last  i t em  is  important  since  stall 
c u r r e nt  is  29  amps  for  the  link  1  motor  and  32  amps

The  m o t or  for  link  3  (boom)  is  unhoused  and 
mounted  in  the  drive  b a r r el  for  the  boom  elevation 

link.  This  is  a  high  torque  motor  d i r e c t ly  coupled  to 
the  load. 
It  is  a  conventional  m o t o r,  as  compared  to 
the  motors  which  drive  the  next  two  l i n k s.  These  are 
pancake-type  motors  that  are  wound  in  half  the  n o r(cid:173)

housings  and  support  shafts  but  they  offer  greater

component  sets  was  specified  in  order  to  reduce  lost

Only  part  of  this  is  backlash,

In  addition, 

the  design 

Gear  ratios  were  chosen  to  optimize  the 

d r i v i n g / d r i v en  inertia  r a t i o.  The  d r i v i ng  i n e r t ia 
consists  of  the  i n e r t ia  on  the  input  shaft:  the  motor 
a r m a t u r e, 
tachometer  a r m a t u r e,  etc.  The  d r i v en 
inertia  is  the  load  i n e r t ia  or  the  link  i n e r t i a.  The 
i n e r t ia  reflected  f r om  the  input  shaft  to  the  output 
shaft  is  increased  by  n2  where  n  is  the  gear  r a t i o. 
When  the  reflected  input  inertia  equals  the  output 
i n e r t i a,  m a x i m um  power  is  t r a n s m i t t e d.  As  an 
example,

The  brakes  and  tachometers  are  mounted  on 
the  same  shaft  as  the  motor  for  the  f i r st  five  links. 
F i g.  3  shows  an  assembly  view  of  link  4.  The  brake 
is  at  the  left, 
the  Harmonic  D r i v e,  output  shaft,  potentiometer  and 
link  drive  housing. 
The  tachometers  selected  for 
these  links  are  physically  identical  to  the  motors 
d r i v i ng  the  fourth  and  f i f th  links  (shown  in  F i g.  4). 
This  s i m i l a r i ty  allows  part  interchangeability 
(brushes  and  field  magnets)  and  simplifies  the  i n s t a l(cid:173)
lation  p r o b l e m.  The  brakes  selected  are  capable  of 
holding  the  links  stationary  against  the  largest  expec(cid:173)
ted  gravity  loads. 
In  links  3  through  6  and  the  hand, 
the  brake  torque  exceeds  the  motor  torques. 
In  the 
base  the  only  gravity  torque  is  on  joint  2,  where  the 
brake  is  capable  of  holding  a  5-pound  object  at  m a x i(cid:173)
m um  extension.  Z e ro  backlash  units  are  used.  A ll 
brakes, 
tachometers  and  motors  are  assembled  so 
that  they  may  be  disassembled.  There  are  no  press 
fits  or  plastic  cements  and  the  magnetic  keepers  can 
be  reinstalled  on  the  motors  and  tachometers  p r i or 
to  removing  the  a r m a t u r e s.  Since  the  purchased 
parts  are  c o m m e r c i al  i t e m s,  dimensions  may  vary 
f r om  the  manufacturers  specification  sheet.  The 
least  costly  way  of  allowing  for  this  is  to  provide  the 
purchased  parts  to  the  machine  shop  at  the  time  of 
fabrication.  Of  course, 
this  would  not  be  p r a c t i c al 
for  a  mass  produced  manipulator  and  dimension 
control  drawing  would  be  used.  A  zero-buildup  green 
anodize  was  used  to  provide  better  spectral  response 
to  the  TV  cameras. 

The  nonstandard  potentiometers  were  manufac(cid:173)

bonded  to  a  fiberglass  backing  and  the  backing  and

t u r n,  0 . 0 1%  l i n e a r i ty  device,  while  the  hand  unit  is 
a  5  t u r n,  0. 05%  device. 

Since  the  sixth  link  has  only  i n e r t ia  loads  and 

the  hand  task  is  only  to  grasp  an  object, 
the  p r i me 
consideration  in  this  design  was  size,  both  of  c o m(cid:173)
ponents  and  their  packaging.  The  smallest  compo(cid:173)
nents  available  were  chosen,  and  rather  than  mount 
them  c o - l i n e a r l y, 
the  components  were  clustered 
around  a  central  axis.  This  gives  a  short  length 
(and  less  gravity  torques)  at  the  expense  of  increased 
d i a m e t e r.  This  was  also  a  reason  for  e l i m i n a t i ng 
the  use  of  slip  r i n g s. 

The  hand  shown  in  F i g.  4  is  a  simple  p a r a l l el 
jaw  device. 
It  is  d r i v en  by  a  motor  identical  to  the 
one  used  in  link  6.  Position  feedback  and  a  brake 
for  holding  loads  are  provided.  The  hand  is  attached 
to  the  sixth  link  at  one  plane  w i th  six  s c r e w s,  a l l o w(cid:173)
ing  easy  interchangeability  w i th  other  types  of  hands 
or  other  t e r m i n al  devices.  E x t ra  w i r es  are  provided 
for  additional  hand  sensors  ( p r o x i m i t y, 
etc.)  which  w i ll  be  added  l a t e r.

In  a  f u r t h er  e f f o rt  to  reduce  noise,  analog 

drive  c i r c u i t ry  was  selected,  as  opposed  to  pulse 
width  modulated  (PWM)  d r i v e.  Some  efficiency  is 
lost,  but  the  analog  drive  does  not  produce  the  noise 
on  the  i n s t r u m e nt  lines  that  P WM  does.  Since  high 
gain  a m p l i f i e rs  are  used  they  may  be  configured  to 
give  either  a  linear  voltage  gain  or  a  linear  voltage 
to  c u r r e nt  conversion. 
The  latter  gives  m o re  p r e(cid:173)

An  AI  manipulator  has  been  designed  and  is 
shown  in  F i g.  5.  This  manipulator  is  r e p r e s e n t a(cid:173)
tive  of  the  class  of  manipulators  which  have  fast 
response,  high  torque  output  and  high  accuracy.

The  manipulator  design  provides  a  great  deal 

in  its 

complete  computer  control  or  p a r(cid:173)

of  f l e x i b i l i ty  in  the  way  it  can  be  c o n t r o l l e d, 
applications  and  allowances  for  further  development. 
There  are  a  v a r i e ty  of  c o n t r ol  modes  that  can  be 
accommodated: 
t i al  analog  servo  d r i v e;  c u r r e nt  drive  or  voltage

It  may  be  used  in  a  system  that  is  p r i m i t i ve 
at  the  s t a r t,  w i th  only  crude  sensory  data,  and  yet 
the  design  is  sophisticated  enough  to  p e r f o rm  c o m(cid:173)
