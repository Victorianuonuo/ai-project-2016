relationships  that  were  Shown  to  hold  in  D 
must  necessarily  hold  in  G. 
In  p a r t i c u l a r, 
the  gradients  of  the  i n t e r p r e t a t i on  plane  and 
the  two  object  surfaces  that  intersect  in,  an 
edge  must  be  on  the  gradient  l i ne  of  that  edge. 

The  o r i e n t a t i on  of  a  picture  l i ne  deter­

mines  the  d i r e c t i on  of  the  grad ient  of  i ts

The  above  remarks  ar.v  a ll  true  regardless 

oi'  the  viewing  posi t ion,  V,  and  so  are  true 
for  both  orthographic  and  perspective 
p i c t u r e s.  We  shall  now  concern  ourselves 
with  the  gradient  space  for'  orthographic 
p i c t u r e s.  The  duals  oi'  a ll  the  interpretation

the;ii  i n to  G  wi llztbere'f oru  put  a ll  t h e ir 
gradients  at  i n f i n i ty  (they  become 
ideal 
points  in  the  gradient  space).  Another  way 
of  looking  at  it  is  to  realize  that  as  V"  goes 
f u r t h er  from  the  picture  plane  the  angles 
between  the  picture  and  the  i n t e r p r e t a t i on 
planes  a ll  approach  90°  and  so  the  lengths  oi' 
the  gradients  approach  tan  90"  (-*00). 

The  distance  of  !„  from  0,,  increases 

with  the  (presumed)  distance  in  real  space  of 
the  viewing  point  V  from  the  picture  plane. 
The  projection  onto  G  of  the  dual  of  the  edge 
depicted  by  the  picture  l i n e,  wi J  !.  be  a  l i ne 
passing  through  I «.  For  any  picture  l i ne 
there  is  an  i n f i n i te  family  of  such  l i n es  in 
G  being  the  p r o j e c t i on  onto  G  oi'  duals  of 
the  possible  edfes  depicted  by  tht:  l i n e.  As 
V  tends  to  i n f i n i t y, 
the  picture  tends  to  an 
orthographic  projection  of  the  scene  and  1„ 
tends  to  an  ideal  p o i n t.  The  family  of  edge 
gradient  l i n es  in  G  simultaneously  tends 
toward  a  set  oi'  p a r a l l el  l i n es  whose  o r i e n t a­
t i on  is  that  of  the  d i r e c t i on  of  IQ.,  that  i s, 
perpendicular  to  the  picture  l i n e. 

Consider  an  orthographic  picture  of  a 

scene  with  a  v i s i b le  edge  j o i n i ng  two  v i s i b le 
surfaces,  A  and  B. 
(We  c a ll  such  an  edge,  a 
'connect'  edge).  The  gradient  space  configu­
r a t i on  corresponding  to  that  consists  oi'  the 
two  gradients  (G,  and  Gg)  joined  by  a  l i ne 
which  is  the  projection  of  the  dual  of  the 
edge.  That  l i ne  is  perpendicular  to  the 
picture  l i ne  if  the  gradient  space 
imposed  on  the  picture  space  as  described 

is  super­

above.  Moreover,  it  can  easily  be  shown  that 
if  the  gradients  are  ordered  on  the  dual  line 
in  the  same  direction  as  the  corresponding 
surfaces  appear  at  the  edgethen  that  edge  is 
convex  but  if  they  are  ordered  in  the  reverse 
direction  then  it  is  concave. 
imagine  a  convex  edge  then  rotate  one  of  the 
surfaces  u n t il  the  edge  becomes  concave. 
When  the  edge  is  f l a t,  the  gradients  must 
coincide).  This  crucial  fact  allows  the 
exploitation  of  the  gradient  space  for  convex/ 
concave  interpretations. 

( I n t u i t i v e l y, 

As  a  simple  example  of  the  use  of  t h is 

consider  a  FORK  junction  (Fig.  3)  where  it  is 
known  that  a ll  the  edges  are  connect.  The 
configuration  of  the  gradients  of  surfaces,  A, 
B  and  C,  (G., GBi and  G„)  can  only  take  on  one 
of  the  two  forms'  of  F i g . h if  they  are  to 
satisfy  the  requirement  that  the  mutual 
vector  difference  be  perpendicular  to  the  line 
depicting  the  edge  that  connects  the  two 
surfaces.  These  configurations  can,  of  course, 

be  translated  and  expanded  in  the  gradient 

space  and  s t i ll  satisfy  the  requirement.  Com(cid:173)
paring  the  relative  positions  of  the  gradients 
in  Fig.U(a)  with  the  ordering  of  the  regions 
in  the  picture  shows  that  a ll  the  edges  must 
be  convex  for1  that  interpretation  while  for 
the  interpretation  given  by  Fig.U(b)  a ll  the 
edges  must  be  concave.  That  switch  of  i n t e r(cid:173)

Description jsf _t_he_program 

The  task  for  POLY  can  be  specified  as 

follows:  using  these  constraints  on  the 
coherent  interpretation  of  polyhedra  subjected 
to  t h is  picture-taking  process  what  informa(cid:173)
t i on  can  be  derived  from  the  picture? 
particular,  the  program  must  provide  easily 
accessible  answers  to  questions,  such  as, 

In 

uhe  end  points  of  the  l i n e s.  The  parsing 
phase  recovers  the  picture  structure  by 
examining  the  lines  for  j o in  relationships, 
and  establishing  the  junctions  and  closures 
and  the  regions  made  up  of  closures.  The 
picture  structure  is  that  given  in  Fig.6(a). 
Then  the  scene  correspondents  of  t h is  data 
structure  are  created  following  the  relation 
of  representation1as  shown  in  Fig.6(b). 

The  CONNECT  part  of  the  program  uses  the 

rules  of  coherence  sketched  e a r l i er  to 
establish  which  edges  are  connect  and  which 
are  not.  This  part  of  the  program  searches 
over  a  binary  tree  with  each  level  represent(cid:173)
ing  a  different  edge  in  the  scene,  the  l e ft 
branches  being  connectfedge)  =  true  and  the 
right  branches  connect(edge)  =  false.  This 
tree  is  not  searched  in  either  of  the  conven(cid:173)
tional  depth-first  or  breadth-first  ways.  To 
achieve  the  most  connected  interpretation 
f i r s t,  the  top  level  goal  requires  a ll  edges 
to  be  connected  and  then,  when  that  f a i l s,  a ll 
edges  but  one  and  so  on.  The  tree  search  is 
effected  by  the  usual  backtracking  method  with 
state  saving  which  in  t h is  case  is  achieved 
by  a  recursive  procedure.  The  edges  are  not 
searched  in  random  order;  starting  from  the 
background  region  each  region  is  interpreted 
in  turn: 
the  next  region  chosen  is  that 
uninterpreted  region  with  the  most  lines 
adjacent  to  the  interpreted  regions. 
context,  to  interpret  a  region  means  to  f ix 
the  position  of  the  corresponding  surface  in 
gradient  space.  Because  the  region  selected 
by  that  c r i t e r i on  w i ll  correspond  to  the  most 
constrained  surface, 
this  strategy  results  in 
the  most  e f f i c i e nt  search.  So,  in  f a c t,  the 
order  of  the  search  is  given  in  advance  by 
the  parser  but  there  is  no  reason  why  the 
program 
dynamically  if  it  were  embedded  in  a  larger 
system  that  could  supply  advice  or  hypotheses 
about  the  orientation  of  particular  surfaces 
or  the  status  of  various  edges.

A  program, POLY,  w i ll  now  be  described  which

a  useful  embodiment  of  most  of  the  knowledge 
specific  to  these  picture  and  scene  domains 
and  their  interrelationship  that  a  scene-based 
problem  solver  would  need  to  have  available. 
The  overall  structure  of  POLY  is  shown  in 
Fig.5.  The  program  is  written  in  ALGOL  60 
extended  to  allow  for  the  representation  and 
manipulation  of  data  objects,  attributes  and 
binary  relationships.  The  input  is  obtained 
by  drawing  a  picture  on  the  graphical  display; 
'the  input  phase  passes  to  the  parsing  phase

it  then  examines  the  lines  on  the 

A  simple  example  w i ll  make  the  workings 
of  CONTACT  clearer.  Consider  the  picture  in 
Fig.7-  CONNECT  f a i ls  to  find  any  interpreta(cid:173)
t i on  with  f i ve  or  with  four  connect  edges  for 
reasons  that  w i ll  become  obvious.  So  with 
the  goal  of  establishing  three  connect  edges, 
CONNECT  starts  with  the  background  A,  and  for 
convenience  sets  G,,  at  the  o r i g in  in  gradient 
space, 
inner  closure  of  A  ( 1,  2,  it-  and  5)  and  finds 
that  none  of  the  regions  on  the  other  sides 
of  those  lines  have  been  interpreted  so  it 
can  say  nothing  yet  about  these  l i n e s. 
It 
then  chooses  the  uninterpreted  region  that 
has  the  most  adjacencies  to  the  interpreted 
regions  as  the  next  region  to  i n t e r p r e t.  The 
ordering  of  the  edges  as  a  tree  is  determined 
by  t h is  strategy  of  addressing  the  picture. 
Both  B  and  C  have  two  adjacencies  so  the 
choice  is  a r b i t r a r y,  say,  B.  Now  it  examines 
lines  on  the  outer  closure  of  B  in  sequence 
t r y i ng  to  establish  connect  edges.  Say  it 
looks  at  1  f i r s t. 
connect  edge  which  means  that  GR  must  l ie  on 
a  l i ne  perpendicular  to  1  through  G.  =(0,0). 

It  establishes  it  as  a 

In  general  the  position  of  a  gradient  is 
defined  by  the  intersection  of  two  or  more  l i(cid:173)
nes  in  the  gradient  space  arising  from  edges 
assigned  connect  status;  however,  for  the 
f i r st  two  gradients  (aA  and  GB,  here)  there  is 

no  IOSB  of  generality  if  we  do  not  use  that 
requirement  to  locate  them  since  the  origin 
and  scale  of  the  gradient  space  can  "be  subse(cid:173)
quently  altered.  So  we  put  GB  at  unit 
distance  from  G,  on  that  l i n e.  The  next 
picture  l i ne  t o ^e  considered  is  2,  which 
CONNECT  also  t r i es  to  establish  as  a  connect 
edge  but  this  would  require  GB  to  l ie  on  a 
line  perpendicular  to  2  through  G.  which  is 
incompatible  with  the  current  interpretation 
of  GR,  Thus  the  interpretation  in  which  both 
1  ana  2  are  connect  edges  is  said  to  be 
incoherent.  This  makes  it  clear  why  CONNECT 
f a i l ed  in  i ts  original  goal  of  establishing 
a ll  the  edges  as  connect  edges.  2  is 
established  as  an  occluding  edge  and  CONNECT 
looks  next  at  3*  Since  the  region  on  the 
other  side,C,  is  not  yet  interpreted,  it  says 
nothing  about  3.  The  remaining  region  C  is 
then  interpreted.  3  is  established  as  a 
connect  edge  requiring  G_  to  l ie  on  a  line 
perpendicular  to  3  passing  through  G  .  The 
actual  position  of  0„  is  established  by 
defining  i ts  relationship  to  Q  by  making 4 
or  5  (but  not  both)  connect  edges.  The  inter-
pretation  in  which  1,  3  and  5  are  connect  and 
2  and  1+  are  occluding  edges  is  rejected  by 
the  single  rule  that  three  non-collinear 
points  in  space  (the  corners  a,  b  and  c) 
cannot  simultaneously  l ie  on  two  planes  (A  and 
B).  So  one  legal  connect  interpretation  is 
that  1,  3  and  4  arc  connect  edges  while  2 
and  5  are  not.  Continued  search  of  the  tree 
v.rill  only  yield  one  moreinterpretation  with  3 
connect  edges,  v i s.  2,  3  and  5  connect,  1  and 
Occluding.  For  1,  3  and  4  connect  the  f i n al 
gradient  space  configuration  w i ll  be  as  shown 
in  Fig.S,  in  which  the  gradient  line  of 
connect  edge  1  is  labelled  as  1'  etc. 

Then  VEXCAVE  takes  over  and  decides 
which  of  the  connect  edges  arc  convex  and 
which  concave.  VEXCAVE  starts  by  p a r t i t(cid:173)
ioning  the  gradient  space  graph  into  2-con-
nccted  subgraphs8'  using  the  gradient  lines  of 
connect  edges  as  arcs.  For  each  subgraph 
VEXCAVE  then  determines  i ts  two  possible 
interpretations  using  the  ordering  rule  for 
gradients. 
decide  in  the  interpretation  for  which  1,  3 
and  4,  are  connect  edges  that  the  whole  graph 
is  2-cDnnected  and  that  either  1  and  4  are 
concave  edges  while  3  is  convex  or  1  and  4 
are  convex  while  3  is  concave.  Note  that, 
for  the  l a t t er  interpretation,  junction  b  is 
assigned  an  'accidental'  status. 

In  the  example,  VEXCAVE  w i ll 

F i n a l l y,  OCCLUDE  looks  at  the  non-conn-

ect  edges  and  uses  two  inference  rules  to 
achieve  a  complete  interpretation.  The  f i r st 
rule  expresses  the  fact  that  if  two  surfaces 
intersect  in  a  connect  edgethat  is  known  to 
be,  say,  convex  then  at  any  position  in  the 
picture  it  w i ll  be  apparent  which  surface  is 
in  front.  Using  this  rule  it  becomes  clear, 
for  many  occluding  edges,  which  surface  (of 
the  two  that  it  apparently  bounds)  the  edge 
actually  belongs  t o.  The  rule  also  adds  a 
hidden  surface  attached  to  that  edge.  The 
fact  that  such  a  surface  is  both  turned  away 
from  the  viewing  direction  and  obscured  by 
the  visible  surface  means  that  it  obeys  the 
same  constraint  as  it  would  if  the  edge  were 
concave  and  connect.  This  rule  is  used  in 
the  example  to  decide  for  the  case  where  1  and 
4 are  concave  and  3  is  convex  that  occluding 
edges  2  and  5  belong  to  surfaces  B  and  C 

559 

In  the  example 

It  does  t h is  by 

respectively.  The  second  rule  for  occlusion 
completes  the  polygon  of  gradients  corres(cid:173)
ponding  to  the  visible  and  hidden  surfaces 
meeting  at  each  corner. 
allowing  for  the  hidden  surfaces  created  by 
the  f i r st  rule  and  introducing  the  minimum 
number  of  extra  hidden  surfaces  required. 
The  minimum  number  is  achieved  by  allowing 
two  occluding  edges  to  share  the  same  hidden 
surface  wherever  possible. 
the  second  rule  confirms  that  the  polygon  of 
gradients  is  complete  for  corner  c  since  the 
surfaces  at  that  corner,  A,  B  and  C  are  a ll 
visible  and  there  are  no  occluding  edges. 
For  corner  d  it  completes  the  polygon  by 
introducing  a  hidden  edge  between  the  hidden 
surface  at  edge  5  and  the  background. 
Similarly  for  corner  a  and  the  hidden  surface 
at  edge  2.  Then  at  corner  b  it  decides  that 
those  two  hidden  surfaces  could  be  the  same 
surface,  D,  and  s t i ll  obey  the  constraints. 
So  the  f i n al  gradient  space  configuration  is 
f i g .9  which  looks  l i ke  a  picture  of  a  wire(cid:173)
frame  tetrahedron  because  the  tetrahedron  is 
'only  self-dual  polyhedron4. 

The  interpretation  pursued  in  the 

example  above  is  one  of  the  f i r st  produced  by 
POLY  but  the  program  w i ll  continue  to  generate 
less  connected  interpretations.  For  example, 
the  tetrahedron  separate  from  the  background 
surface  has  only  one  connect  edge,  3 ',  but  i ts 
gradient  space  configuration  has  the  same 
structure  as  Fig.9  with  the  exception  that  Q. 
in  that  figure  is  replaced  by  the  gradient  01 
a  second  hidden  surface, GE and  GA  is  now  an 
isolated  point  in  gradient  space. 
tations  such  as  this  with  complete  bodies 
separate  from  the  background  can  be  easily 
generated  f i r st  by  giving  CONNECT  the  advice 
that  a ll  the  lines  on  the  inner  closure  of 
the  frame  represent  non-connect  edges. 

Interpre(cid:173)

When  OCCLUDE  has  finished  then  the 

Interpretation  process  is  complete.  Each  edge 
in  the  scene  data  structure  is  related  to 
other  scene  entities  such  as  the  surfaces  it 
bounds  and  the  corners  which  bound  i t.  An 
edge  node  also  contains  attributes  such  as 
connect,  convex,  concave  or  occluding  and  i ts 
slope  relative  to  the  picture  plane.  Nodes 
for  the  original  visible  surfaces  and  the 
hidden  surfaces  introduced  by  OCCLUDE  contain 
the  gradient  vectors  which  are  relative  to 
the  gradient  of  some  other  surface,  usually 
the  background.  These  gradients  may  be 
uniformly  scaled  by  a  positive  number  before 
being  added  to  the  gradient  of  that  other 
surface  to  obtain  the  true  gradient.  The 
scale  factor  must  be  positive  because  the  work 
done  by  OCCLUDE  on  the  hidden  surfaces  w i ll 
not  survive  the  Necker  transformation  that  a 
negative  scale  factor  would  involve.  This 
transformation  was  allowed  for  earlier,  in 
VEXCAVE,  when  two  versions  of  the  configura(cid:173)
tion  were  generated. 

Two  further  points  about  the  program 

should  be  made.  F i r s t,  POLY  has  no  d i f f i c u l ty 
in  making  sense  of  cracks  as  in  Fig.10. 
Cracks  are  simply  connect  edges  where  the  two 
adjacent  surfaces  have  identical  gradients. 
Finally,  the  processing  time  required  to 
produce  the  f i r st  interpretation  is 
proportional  to  the  number  of  picture  lines  if 
that  interpretation  is  completely  connected 
but  that  tends  towards  an  exponential
