Introduction 

V a r i o us  studies  have  been  c a r r i ed  out  on 

the  o p t i m um  method  of  designing  the  recognition

method  can  be  u t i l i z ed  in  the  recognition  of  a 
l i m i t ed  font.  However, 
it  is  not  very  effective  in 
the  recognition  of  h a n d - p r i n t ed  characters  w h i ch

Thus  the

Many  w o r k e rs  postulated  that  in  the 

recognition  of  the  h a n d - p r i n t ed  c h a r a c t e r s, 
it  is 
advantageous  to  extract  the  detectable  features

if 

n e c e s s a r y,  a ll  of  the  input  characters  a re 
recognized  once  m o re  by  the  updated  sequential 
logic  f i l e,  and  we  can  obtain  the  percentage  of  the 
c o r r e ct  r e c o g n i t i on  of  the  input  c h a r a c t e rs  by 
assigning  the  C A LL  light  button. 

H a rd  Copy  O r d er 

When  we  want  a  h a rd  copy  of  the  i n f o r m a t i on 

on  the  C R T,  we  can  have  it  p r i n t ed  by  the  l i ne 
p r i n t er  by  assigning  the  l i g ht  button  L N P R. 

Bit  P a t t e rn  Display 

T h e re  a re  t wo  methods  of  o r d e r i ng  the 

display  of  bit  p a t t e rn  in  a  f o rm  of  input  c h a r a c t e r. 
The  f i r st  method  is  to  p r e ss  the  P TN  key  and 
assign  the  input  c h a r a c t er  n u m b er  to  be  displayed 
on  the  CRT  by  means  of  the  keyboard. 
The  second 
method  is  to  designate  the  input  c h a r a c t er 
n u m b e rs  to  be  displayed  on  the  C R T,  w h i le  the 
F i g.  6  is  being  d i s p l a y e d.  The  d i g i t i z ed  p a t t e rn 
of  the  designated  input  c h a r a c t er  and  the  feature 
a r r ay  a re  displayed  on  the  C R T. 

This  display  may  give  means  to  r e v i s i ng 
the  defective  l o g ic  m o re  i n t u i t i v e ly  than  feature 
a r r a y. 
It  may  also  p r e v e nt  the  adoption  of 
i n e f f e c t i ve  features  r e s u l t i ng  f r om  the  poor 
p r i n t i ng  quality  i n to  the  sequential  l o g i c.

Testing 

Tests  w e re  made  of  the  effectiveness  of  the 

s y s t em  used  in  the  design  of  h a n d - p r i n t ed 

In  F i g.  8  each  feature  is  shown  w i th  a  code. 

This  combination  of  l e t t e rs  and  symbols  to 
represent  the  features  enables  us  to  conceive  the 
shape  of  the  feature  easily. 
the  input  c h a r a c t er  and  the  feature  a r r ay  obtained 
f r om  the  bit  p a t t e rn  a re  shown  in  F i g.  9. 

The  bit  p a t t e rn  of 

The  sequential  logic  can  be  expressed  by 
the  t r a n s i t i on  d i a g r am  shown  in  F i g.  10,  F i g.  11 
shows  the  confusion  m a t r ix  concerning  the 
500  input  characters  in  this  i n v e s t i g a t i o n.

Conclusion 

F r om  e x p e r i m e nt  on  the  construction  of 

it  was 

sequential  logic  u t i l i z i ng  this  s y s t e m, 
found  that  the  l a b or  needed  to  select  the 
n e c e s s a ry  data  f r om  a  m u l t i t u de  of  i n f o r m a t i on 
was  g r e a t ly  reduced  and  that  the  r e v i s i on  of 
sequential  logic  owing  to  the  c h a r a c t er  editing 
function  is  c a r r i ed  out  efficiently. 
was  v e ry  effective  in  d e t e r m i n i ng  how  to 
construct  a  sequential  l o g i c,  and  combine  t wo 
sequential  l o g i c s,  since  we  can  make  use  of 
man's  highly  developed  concept  of  p a t t e r n s. 

The  s y s t em 

In  the  e x p e r i m e n t,  magnetic  tape  was  used 

as  an  e x t e r n al  m e m o r y.  We  w e re  not  s a t i s f i ed 
w i th  the  t u r n - a r o u nd  t i m e.  H o w e v e r,  we  believe 
that  the  p r o b l em  can  be  solved  by  using  a  l a r ge 
capacity  r a n d om  access  m e m o ry  such  as  a 
magnetic  disk, 

instead  of  magnetic  tape.
