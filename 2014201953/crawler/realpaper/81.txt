Abstract

In this paper, two families of merging operators are
considered: quota operators and Gmin operators.
Quota operators rely on a simple idea: any pos-
sible world is viewed as a model of the result of
the merging when it satis(cid:2)es (cid:147)suf(cid:2)ciently many(cid:148)
bases from the given pro(cid:2)le (a multi-set of bases).
Different interpretations of the (cid:147)suf(cid:2)ciently many(cid:148)
give rise to speci(cid:2)c operators. Each Gmin op-
erator is parameterized by a pseudo-distance and
each of them is intended to re(cid:2)ne the quota oper-
ators (i.e., to preserve more information). Quota
and Gmin operators are evaluated and compared
along four dimensions: rationality, computational
complexity, strategy-proofness, and discriminating
power. Those two families are shown as interest-
ing alternatives to the formula-based merging oper-
ators (which selects some formulas in the union of
the bases).

1 Introduction
Merging operators aim at de(cid:2)ning the beliefs (resp. goals) of
a group of agents from their individual beliefs (resp. goals).
The merging problem in the propositional setting has been
addressed in many works, both from the arti(cid:2)cial intelligence
community and the database community [Cholvy, 1993;
Revesz, 1997; Liberatore and Schaerf, 1998; Lin and Mendel-
zon, 1999; Baral et al., 1991; 1992; Konieczny and Pino
P·erez, 2002a].
It is also close to important issues consid-
ered in Social Choice Theory [Arrow, 1963; Moulin, 1988;
Arrow et al., 2002].

Each operator is more or less suited to the many merging
scenarios which can be considered. Subsequently, when fac-
ing an application for which merging is required, a (cid:2)rst dif(cid:2)-
culty is the choice of a speci(cid:2)c merging operator. Among the
criteria which can be used to make a clever choice, are the
following ones:
Rationality: A main requirement for adhering to a merging
method is that it offers the expected properties of what
intuitively (cid:147)merging(cid:148) means. This calls for sets of ra-
tionality postulates and this has been addressed in sev-
eral papers [Revesz, 1997; Liberatore and Schaerf, 1998;
Konieczny and Pino P·erez, 2002a]. In the following, we

focus on the rationality postulates given in [Konieczny
and Pino P·erez, 2002a], because they extend other pro-
posals. The more (w.r.t. set inclusion) postulates satis-
(cid:2)ed the more rational the operator.

Computational Complexity: When one looks for a merg-
ing operator for an autonomous multi-agent system, a
natural requirement is computational ef(cid:2)ciency. In the
worst case, merging is not a computationally easy task,
and query answering typically lies at the (cid:2)rst or even the
second level of the polynomial hierarchy. Computation-
ally easier operators can be obviously preferred to more
complex ones.

Strategy-proofness: It is usually expected for merging that
agents report truthfully their beliefs/goals. For many ap-
plications, this assumption can easily be made, in par-
ticular when the agents have limited reasoning abilities.
However, when rational agents with full inference power
are considered, such an assumption must be questioned:
agents can be tempted to misreport their beliefs/goals in
order to achieve a better merging result from their point
of view. Strategy-proof operators must be preferred in
such a case.

Discriminating Power: Because information is typically
hard to be acquired, another important criterion to com-
pare merging operators is cautiousness: merging oper-
ators which preserve only few information from the in-
dividual bases cannot be considered as valuable ones.
Thus, it is natural to prefer operators leading to consis-
tent merged bases that are as strong as possible from an
inferential point of view.

As to rationality, one can look at [Revesz, 1997; Liberatore
and Schaerf, 1998; Lin and Mendelzon, 1999; Konieczny,
2000; Konieczny and Pino P·erez, 2002a; Konieczny et al.,
2002]. As to computational complexity, see [Konieczny et al.,
2002], and for a study of strategy-proofness of many merging
operators, a recent reference is [Everaere et al., 2004] (see
also [Meyer et al., 2001] for a related study concerning OCF
merging operators). In light of those results, it appears that no
merging operator is a better performer than any other operator
with respect to the four criteria. To be more precise model-
based operators1 are often computationally easier (inference

some interpretations that are the (cid:147)closest(cid:148) to the bases, and formula-

2-complete) than formula-
2-complete) [Konieczny et al.,
based ones (inference can be (cid:5)p
2002]. Model-based operators also typically satisfy more ra-
tionality postulates (see [Konieczny and Pino P·erez, 2002a;
Konieczny, 2000]). The third criterion is much more dif(cid:2)-
cult to satisfy for both families of operators, even in very re-
stricted cases. Actually, most of the merging operators iden-
ti(cid:2)ed so far in the literature are not strategy-proof. Since the
four evaluation criteria appear hard to be satis(cid:2)ed altogether,
one cannot do better than searching for good trade-offs.

We consider in this paper two families of propositional
merging operators. The (cid:2)rst one consists of quota merging
operators. They rely on a simple idea: any possible world is
viewed as a model of the result of the merging when it satis-
(cid:2)es (cid:147)suf(cid:2)ciently many(cid:148) bases from the given pro(cid:2)le. (cid:147)Suf(cid:2)-
ciently many(cid:148) can mean either (cid:147)at least k(cid:148) (any integer, abso-
lute quota), or (cid:147)at least k%(cid:148) (a relative quota), or (cid:2)nally (cid:147)as
many as possible(cid:148), and each interpretation gives rise to a spe-
ci(cid:2)c merging operator. We show that those operators exhibit
good logical properties, have low computational complexity
and are strategy-proof. Since this is achieved at the price of a
potential lack of discriminating power, we introduce a second
family of merging operators: Gminoperators. Each Gminop-
erator is parameterized by a pseudo-distance and each of them
is intended to re(cid:2)ne the quota operators (i.e., to preserve more
information). Such operators are both more rational and more
discriminating than quota merging operators. Unfortunately,
this improvement has to be paid by a higher computational
complexity, and more strategic vulnerabilities, but we think
they offer an interesting compromise nevertheless.

Note that aggregation functions close to the ones on which
quota and Gmin operators are based are used to deal with
relational structures that are more complex than bipartitions
of worlds (which are the structures under consideration in
standard propositional logic). For instance, they have been
considered in the possibilistic logic setting and for constraint
[Dubois et al., 1999; 1998;
satisfaction problems (see e.g.
Fargier, 1994]). However, as far as we know, no systematic
study of quota and Gminoperators has been conducted so far
in the standard propositional setting. Especially, they have
never been evaluated with respect to the four criteria we con-
sider. This is where the main contribution of the paper lies.

The rest of the paper is as follows. The next section gives
some notations and de(cid:2)nitions. In Section 3, quota operators
are de(cid:2)ned and their properties are studied. In Section 4, we
de(cid:2)ne 4kmax, which is the operator obtained when optimiz-
ing the value of the quota under the constraint that it does not
lead to an inconsistent merged base. In Section 5, 4GMIN op-
erators are de(cid:2)ned and their properties are studied. Finally,
we conclude this paper in Section 6.

2 Formal Preliminaries
We consider a propositional language L de(cid:2)ned from a (cid:2)nite
set of propositional variables P and the usual connectives.

An interpretation (or world) is a total function from P to
f0; 1g, denoted by a bit vector whenever a strict total order on
P is speci(cid:2)ed. The set of all interpretations is noted W. An

based ones, which pick some formulas in the union of the bases is
often made [Konieczny et al., 2002].

interpretation ! is a model of a formula (cid:30) 2 L if and only if
it makes it true in the usual truth functional way. [(cid:30)] denotes
the set of models of formula (cid:30), i.e., [(cid:30)] = f! 2 W j ! j= (cid:30)g.
A baseK denotes the set of beliefs/goals of an agent, it is a
(cid:2)nite and consistent set of propositional formulas, interpreted
conjunctively. Unless stated otherwise, we identify K with
the conjunction of its elements.

A pro(cid:2)le E denotes the group of agents that is involved
in the merging process. It is a multi-set (bag) of belief/goal
bases E = fK1; : : : ; Kng (hence two agents are allowed to

exhibit identical bases). We denote byV E the conjunction of
bases of E, i.e.,V E = K1^: : :^Kn, andW E is the disjunc-
tion of the bases of E, i.e.,W E = K1 _ : : : _ Kn. A pro(cid:2)le
E is said to be consistent if and only ifV E is consistent. The

multi-set union is noted t, multi-set containment relation is
noted v. The cardinal of a (cid:2)nite set (or a (cid:2)nite multi-set) A
is noted #(A). We say that two pro(cid:2)les are equivalent, noted
E1 (cid:17) E2, if there exists a bijection f from E1 to E2 such that
for every (cid:30) 2 E1, (cid:30) and f ((cid:30)) are logically equivalent.

The result of the merging of the bases of a pro(cid:2)le E, un-
der the integrity constraints (cid:22), is the merged base denoted
4(cid:22)(E). The integrityconstraintsconsist of a consistent for-
mula the merged base has to satisfy (it may represent some
physical laws, some norms, etc.).

3 Quota Operators
Let us (cid:2)rst de(cid:2)ne the quota operators.
De(cid:2)nition 1 Let k be an integer, E = fK1; : : : ; Kng be a
pro(cid:2)le, and (cid:22) be a formula. The k-quota merging operator,
denoted 4k, is de(cid:2)ned in a model-theoretic way as:

[4k

(cid:22)(E)] =( f! 2 [(cid:22)] j 8Ki 2 E ! j= Kig if non empty,

f! 2 [(cid:22)] j #(fKi 2 E j ! j= Kig) (cid:21) kg
otherwise.

Essentially, this de(cid:2)nition states that the models of the re-
sult of the k-quota merging of pro(cid:2)le E under constraints (cid:22)
are the models of (cid:22) which satisfy at least k bases of E. When

there is no con(cid:3)ict for the merging, i.e., V E ^ (cid:22) is consis-

tent, the result of the merging is simply the conjunction of the
bases.
Example 1 Let us consider the following example, with
a pro(cid:2)le E = fK1; K2; K3; K4g, such that
[K1] =
f100; 001; 101g, [K2] = f001; 101g, [K3] = f100; 000g,
[K4] = f111g, and the integrity constraints [(cid:22)] =
W n f010; 011g. With quota operators we get as a re-
sult
(cid:22)(E)] =
f001; 100; 101g and [43

(cid:22)(E)] = f000; 001; 100; 101; 111g,

(cid:22)(E)] = ;.

[42

[41

Here is an equivalent syntactical characterization of
(cid:22)(E)] that is obtained from preferred consistent subsets

[4k
of E.2 Let us (cid:2)rst de(cid:2)ne the following notation:

pnkq = fC (cid:18) f1; : : : ; ng j #(C) = kg:

Then the following proposition gives a characterization of

quota operators :

2To be more precise, (cid:147)subsets(cid:148) stands here for multi-set contain-

ment.

Proposition 1 Let k be an integer, E = fK1; : : : ; Kng be a

Interestingly, the size of the formula equivalent to [4k

(cid:22)(E)]
given by Proposition 1 is polynomial in jEj + j(cid:22)j. Hence,
merged bases can be easily compiled as propositional formu-
las.

3.1 Logical Properties
Since we aim at investigating the logical properties of our
family of merging operators, a set of properties must (cid:2)rst be
considered as a base line. The following set of postulates was
pointed out in [Konieczny and Pino P·erez, 1999; 2002a]:
De(cid:2)nition 2 (IC merging operators) 4 is an IC merging
operator if and only if it satis(cid:2)es the following postulates:
(IC0) 4(cid:22)(E) j= (cid:22)
(IC1) If (cid:22) is consistent, then 4(cid:22)(E) is consistent

(IC2) IfV E is consistent with (cid:22), then 4(cid:22)(E) (cid:17)V E ^ (cid:22)

(IC3) If E1 (cid:17) E2 and (cid:22)1 (cid:17) (cid:22)2, then 4(cid:22)1 (E1) (cid:17) 4(cid:22)2 (E2)
(IC4) If K1 j= (cid:22) and K2 j= (cid:22), then 4(cid:22)(fK1; K2g) ^ K1 is

consistent if and only if 4(cid:22)(fK1; K2g) ^ K2 is consistent

(IC5) 4(cid:22)(E1) ^ 4(cid:22)(E2) j= 4(cid:22)(E1 t E2)
(IC6) If 4(cid:22)(E1) ^ 4(cid:22)(E2) is consistent,

then 4(cid:22)(E1 t E2) j= 4(cid:22)(E1) ^ 4(cid:22)(E2)

(IC7) 4(cid:22)1 (E) ^ (cid:22)2 j= 4(cid:22)1 ^(cid:22)2 (E)
(IC8) If 4(cid:22)1 (E) ^ (cid:22)2 is consistent, then 4(cid:22)1 ^(cid:22)2 (E) j= 4(cid:22)1 (E)
An IC merging operator is said to be an IC majority oper-

ator if it satis(cid:2)es (Maj)

Quota merging operators exhibit good logical properties.

Proposition 2 4k operators satisfy properties (IC0), (IC2),
(IC3), (IC4), (IC5), (IC7) and (IC8). They do not satisfy
(IC1), (IC6) and (Maj) in general.

Only two properties of IC merging operators are not sat-
is(cid:2)ed: (IC1)3 since the result of the quota merging can be
inconsistent (see Example 1), and (IC6).

Beside those general properties, some speci(cid:2)c additional

properties, are satis(cid:2)ed by quota operators.

(Disj) If (W E) ^ (cid:22) is consistent, then 4(cid:22)(E) j= (W E) ^ (cid:22)

3It is possible to make (IC1) satis(cid:2)ed by requiring that, when no
interpretation reaches the quota (i.e., satis(cid:2)es at least k bases), the
merged base is equivalent to the integrity constraints formula. But
this de(cid:2)nition leads to operators which do not satisfy (IC5). This
last property is very important from an aggregation point of view.
It corresponds to a Pareto condition, that is considered as a mini-
mal rationality requirement for aggregation in Social Choice Theory
[Arrow, 1963; Moulin, 1988; Arrow et al., 2002]. This is why we
do not consider such an additional family of operators any longer in
the following.

Interestingly, the disjunction property (Disj) is not shared
by every IC majority merging operator [Konieczny and Pino
P·erez, 2002a], since most of them allow for (cid:147)generating(cid:148)
some new beliefs/goals from the ones in the bases of the pro-
(cid:2)le (some interpretations that do not satisfy any of the bases
can be chosen as models of the merged base). When this
behaviour is unexpected, formula-based merging operators (cid:150)
which satisfy (Disj) (cid:150) can be used, but such operators do not
satisfy many rationality postulates [Konieczny, 2000] (espe-
cially (IC3) is not satis(cid:2)ed) and are often hard from a compu-
tational point of view. Quota operators (as well as the other
operators studied in this paper) which also ensure (Disj) of-
fer interesting alternatives to formula-based operators in this
respect.

Two other interesting postulates can be de(cid:2)ned for char-
acterizing more precisely quota operators; the (cid:2)rst one is a
weakening of (Maj), which is not satis(cid:2)ed by every IC merg-
ing operator:
(Wmaj) If 4(cid:22)(E2) is consistent,

then 9n 4(cid:22) (E1 t E2 t : : : t E2

) ^ 4(cid:22)(E2) is consistent

The second one shows the prominence of the largest
let us de(cid:2)ne

maximal consistent subsets of the pro(cid:2)le;

M axcons(cid:22)(E) as fM j M v E;V M ^ (cid:22) is consistent,
and 8M 0M @ M 0 v E;V M 0 ^ (cid:22) is not consistentg:

satisfy properties

(Disj),

Note that it is not the case that every IC majority merging

operator satis(cid:2)es (Card) (see Section 5).
3.2 Computational Complexity
Let 4 be a merging operator. We consider the following de-
cision problem MERGE(4):

(cid:15) Input : a triple hE; (cid:22); (cid:11)i where E = fK1; : : : ; Kng is

a pro(cid:2)le, (cid:22) 2 L is a formula, and (cid:11) 2 L is a formula.

(cid:15) Question : Does 4(cid:22)(E) j= (cid:11) hold?
For quota merging operators, we can prove that:

Proposition 4 MERGE(4k) is BH(2)-complete.

This BH(2)-completeness result is obtained even in the re-
stricted case the query is a propositional symbol and there is
no integrity constraints ((cid:22) = >). Note that this complexity
class is located at a low level of the boolean hierarchy. And
that, obviously, the complexity of MERGE(4k) decreases to
coNP whenever k is not lower than the number of bases of E

(or under the restrictionV E ^ (cid:22) is inconsistent).

3.3 Strategy-Proofness
Let us now investigate how robust quota operators are with
respect to manipulation.
Intuitively, a merging operator is
strategy-proof if and only if, given the beliefs/goals of the
other agents, reporting untruthful beliefs/goals does not en-
able an agent to improve her satisfaction. A formal counter-
part of it is given in [Everaere et al., 2004]:

De(cid:2)nition 3 Let i be a satisfaction index, i.e., a total function
from L (cid:2) L to IR. A merging operator (cid:1) is strategy-proof for
i if and only if there is no integrity constraint (cid:22), no pro(cid:2)le
E = fK1; : : : ; Kng, no base K and no base K 0 such that

i(K; (cid:1)(cid:22)(E t fK 0g)) > i(K; (cid:1)(cid:22)(E t fKg)):

Clearly, there are numerous different ways to de(cid:2)ne the
satisfaction of an agent given a merged base. While many
ad hoc de(cid:2)nitions can be considered, the following three in-
dexes from [Everaere et al., 2004] are meaningful when no
additional information are available:
De(cid:2)nition 4

if K ^ K(cid:1) is consistent,
otherwise.

if K(cid:1) j= K;
otherwise.

0

(cid:15) idw (K; K(cid:1)) =(cid:26) 1
(cid:15) ids (K; K(cid:1)) =(cid:26) 1
(cid:15) ip(K; K(cid:1)) =(cid:26) #([K]\[K(cid:1)])

#([K(cid:1)])

0

0

if #([K(cid:1)]) 6= 0;
otherwise.

For the weak drastic index (idw), the agent is considered
satis(cid:2)ed as soon as its beliefs/goals are consistent with the
merged base. For the strong drastic index (ids), in order to
be satis(cid:2)ed, the agent must impose her beliefs/goals to the
whole group. The last index ((cid:147)probabilistic index(cid:148) ip) is not a
boolean one, leading to a more gradual notion of satisfaction.
The more compatible the merged base with the agent’s base
the more satis(cid:2)ed the agent. The compatibility degree of K
with K(cid:1) is the (normalized) number of models of K that are
models of K(cid:1) as well.
Proposition 5 Quota merging operators are strategy-proof
for ip, idw and ids.

This is quite noticeable since strategy-proof merging op-
erators are not numerous [Everaere et al., 2004]. Strategy-
proofness is hard to achieve, as illustrated in Social Choice
Theory,
for aggregation of preference relations, by the
Gibbard-Satterthwaite impossibility theorem [Gibbard, 1973;
Satterthwaite, 1975; Moulin, 1988].
3.4 Absolute and Relative Quotas
In the de(cid:2)nition of quota merging operators, an absolute
threshold, i.e., a (cid:2)xed integer not depending on the number
of bases in the pro(cid:2)le, has been used. On the other hand, it
can prove also sensible to express quota in a relative manner,
and to de(cid:2)ne the models of the merged base as the interpre-
tations satisfying at least half (or the two third, or the wanted
ratio) of the initial bases. This technique is close to a well-
known voting method used in Social Choice Theory, namely
voting in committees [Barber(cid:30)a et al., 1991]. Let us call such
operators k-ratio merging operators (with 0 (cid:20) k (cid:20) 1), and let
us note them 4k.
Example 1 (continued) [40:2
[40:3

(cid:22) (E)] = [40:5
One can quickly (cid:2)gure out the close connections between
the two families of quota merging operators (the one based
on absolute quota and the other one on relative quota, or ra-
tio). Each ratio merging operator corresponds to a family of
quota merging operators (one for each possible cardinal of

(cid:22) (E)] = f001; 100; 101g,

(cid:22) (E)] = f001; 100; 101g.

the pro(cid:2)le). And given a (cid:2)xed cardinal, each (absolute) quota
merging operator corresponds to a family of ratio merging
operators.

Although the intuitive motivations of the two de(cid:2)nitions of
those families look different, it turns out that ratio merging
operators have exactly the same properties w.r.t. computa-
tional complexity and strategy-proofness as (absolute) quota
merging operators (though the proofs of some results are dif-
ferent). Only some logical properties are different.
Proposition 6 4k operators satisfy properties (IC0), (IC2),
(IC3), (IC4), (IC5), (IC7), (IC8), (Maj), (Disj) and (Card).
They do not satisfy (IC1) and (IC6) in general.

(E) j= 4k

(cid:22)(E) for all integers k.

4 4kmax Operator
Now, whatever the chosen quota is absolute or not, an impor-
tant point is the choice of its value. Let us (cid:2)rst observe that
quota merging operators lead to a sequence of merged bases
that is monotonic w.r.t. logical entailment:
Proposition 7 Let E be a pro(cid:2)le, (cid:22) be a formula. We have
4k+1

(cid:22)
Among the elements of this sequence, some of them are of
special interest. Thus, 40 gives the conjunction of the bases
(with the constraints) when consistent and (cid:22) otherwise.
It
is called full meet merging operator in [Konieczny and Pino
P·erez, 1999]. 41 gives the conjunction of the bases (with
the constraints) when consistent and the disjunction of the
bases (with the constraints) otherwise; it is closed to the ba-
sicmergingoperator[Konieczny and Pino P·erez, 1999], and
is also de(cid:2)nable as a model-based merging operator obtained
using the drastic distance and max as aggregation function
[Konieczny et al., 2002]. The only difference is that 41 gives
an inconsistent result when the disjunction of the bases is not
consistent with the constraints, whilst the basic merging op-
erator gives (cid:22) in this case.

Each time k is increased, the result of the merging is ei-
ther the same as for the previous value of k or is logically
stronger. In our (cid:2)nite propositional framework, the sequence
(cid:22)(E))(k > 0) is obviously stationary from some stage.
(4k
The value for which it becomes stationary is not interesting
in itself, since the corresponding merged base is either equiv-
alent to the conjunction of the bases of the pro(cid:2)le (with the
constraints), or to the inconsistent base. But an interesting
value of k is the one leading to the last nontrivial merged
base.
De(cid:2)nition 5 Let E = fK1; : : : ; Kng be a pro(cid:2)le, (cid:22) be a
formula. Let kmax = max(fi (cid:20) #(E) j 4i
(cid:22) (E) 6j= ?g).
4kmax is de(cid:2)ned in a model-theoretic way as:

[4kmax

(cid:22)

(E)] =( f! 2 [(cid:22)] j 8Ki 2 E ! j= Kig if non empty,

f! 2 [(cid:22)] j #(fKi 2 E j ! j= Kig) = kmaxg
otherwise.

While very close to quota operators, the resulting operator
4kmax is not a true quota operator since the value of kmax is
not given a priori, but depends on E and (cid:22).
Example 1 (continued) [4kmax

(E)] = f001; 100; 101g.

(cid:22)

At a (cid:2)rst glance, 4kmax looks similar to the formula-based
operator (cid:1)C4 which selects cardinality-maximal subbases in

the union of the bases from the pro(cid:2)le [Konieczny, 2000;
Baral et al., 1991; 1992]; however, 4kmax and (cid:1)C4 are dis-
tinct; thus, while both operators satisfy (Disj), 4kmax satis(cid:2)es
(IC3) and (Maj) while (cid:1)C4 satis(cid:2)es none of them. Contrast-
ingly, 4kmax belongs to two important families of model-
based merging operators, namely the 4(cid:6) family and the
4GM ax family when the drastic distance is used [Konieczny
and Pino P·erez, 2002b]. Accordingly, 4kmax has very good
logical properties:
Proposition 8 4kmax satis(cid:2)es (IC0 - IC8), (Maj), (Disj)
and (Card).

4kmax is obtained by considering the problem of optimiz-
ing the quota (for (cid:147)pure(cid:148) quota operators, k is given, so it
does not need to be computed). Unsurprisingly, the corre-
sponding inference problem is computationally harder than
the inference problem for quota operators (under the standard
assumptions of complexity theory):
Proposition 9 MERGE(4kmax) is (cid:2)p

2-complete.

Clearly enough, if kmax is computed during an off-line pre-
processing stage and becomes part of the input afterwards, the
complexity falls down to coNP.

Now, as to strategy-proofness, the kmax operator exhibits

all the good properties of quota operators.
Proposition 10 4kmax is strategy-proof for the three indexes
ip, idw and ids.

5 4GMIN Operators
Starting from 4kmax, one could wonder whether it is possible
to constrain further the quota operators so as to get operators
with a higher discriminating power, i.e,. allowing more infer-
ences to be drawn. In this section we provide a full family of
such operators.

In order to de(cid:2)ne a 4GMIN operator, the de(cid:2)nition of a

pseudo-distance between interpretations is (cid:2)rst needed:
De(cid:2)nition 6 A pseudo-distancebetween interpretations is a
total function d from W (cid:2) W to IN such that for every !1,
!2 2 W

(cid:15) d(!1; !2) = d(!2; !1), and
(cid:15) d(!1; !2) = 0 if and only if !1 = !2.
Any pseudo-distance between interpretations d induces a
(cid:147)distance(cid:148) between an interpretation ! and a formula K
given by d(!; K) = min!0j=K d(!; !0):

Examples of some such distances are the drasticdistance,
noted dD, that gives 0 when !1 = !2 and 1 otherwise, or the
Dalaldistance[Dalal, 1988], noted dH , that is the Hamming
distance between interpretations.

Then 4d;GMIN

(cid:22)

operators are de(cid:2)ned as:

De(cid:2)nition 7 Let d be a pseudo-distance, (cid:22) an integrity con-
straint, E = fK1; : : : ; Kng a pro(cid:2)le and let ! be an interpre-
tation. The (cid:147)distance(cid:148) dd;Gmin(!; E) is de(cid:2)ned as the list of
numbers (d1; : : : ; dn) obtained by sorting in increasing or-
der the set fd(!; Ki) j Ki 2 Eg. The models of 4d;GMIN
(E)
are the models of (cid:22) that are minimal w.r.t. the lexicographic
order induced by the natural order.

Example 1 (continued) [4dD;GMIN
(E)] = f001; 100; 101g.
(E)] = f101g. The computations are reported in
[4dH ;GMIN
Table 1. Each column Ki gives the (cid:147)distance(cid:148) dH (!; Ki)
between the models of the integrity constraints and Ki.
Clearly enough, 4kmax is a speci(cid:2)c Gminoperator:

Proposition 11 4dD;GMIN = (cid:1)kmax.

As far as discriminating power is concerned, 4GMIN oper-
ators are interesting operators, since they re(cid:2)ne the operator
(cid:1)kmax (so they re(cid:2)ne also every quota merging operator), as
stated by the following property:
Proposition 12 For any pseudo-distance d, any integrity
constraint (cid:22) and any pro(cid:2)le E, we have

4d;GMIN

(cid:22)

(E) j= (cid:1)kmax

(cid:22)

(E)

Furthermore, Gmin operators exhibit very good logical

properties:
Proposition 13 Let d be any pseudo-distance. 4d;GMIN satis-
(cid:2)es (IC0 - IC8), (Maj) and (Disj). It does not satisfy (Card)
in general.

Thus, like formula-based merging operators, 4GMIN opera-
tors satisfy (Disj), but contrariwise to formula-based merging
operators, 4GMIN operators are IC merging operators.

Let us now investigate the strategy-proofness issue for the
4GMIN operators. In the general case, strategy-proofness of
quota merging operators is lost:
Proposition 14 Let d be a pseudo-distance. 4d;GMIN is not
strategy-proof for any index among the three indexes idw ; ip
and ids.

We can guarantee strategy-proofness, but only in some

very speci(cid:2)c cases:
Proposition 15

(cid:15) 4d;GMIN is strategy-proof for ip, idw and ids if the bases

are complete (i.e. each base has a unique model),

(cid:15) 4d;GMIN is strategy-proof for the indexes idw and ids

when #(E) = 2 and (cid:22) = >.

Finally, let us turn to the computational complexity crite-

rion.
Proposition 16 Assume that the pseudo-distance d of any
pair of interpretations !1 and !2 can be computed in time
polynomial in j!1j + j!2j. Then MERGE(4d;GMIN) is in (cid:1)p
2.
Proposition 17

(cid:15) MERGE(4dD;GMIN) is (cid:2)p

2-complete.

2-complete.

(cid:15) MERGE(4dH ;GMIN) is (cid:1)p
As expected, the complexity of inference for 4d;GMIN oper-
ators is higher than the complexity of inference for quota op-
erators (under the usual assumptions of complexity theory).
However, it remains at the (cid:2)rst level of the polynomial hier-
archy under reasonable requirements on the pseudo-distance.

6 Conclusion
We have considered two families of merging operators, and
investigated the properties of their operators with respect to
four criteria: rationality, computational complexity, strategy-
proofness and discrimating power. We claim that those four
criteria are the main dimensions along with propositional
merging operators have to be evaluated.

While no merging operators optimizing every criteria ex-
ist, we claim that both quota and Gminoperators are interest-
ing trade-offs; even if they are not fully rational and discrim-
inating, quota operators exhibit (cid:147)low complexity(cid:148) and are
strategy-proof; on the other hand, Gminoperators are slightly
more complex and not strategy-proof in the general case, but
they are fully rational and much less cautious. They also lead
to merged bases implying the disjunction of the bases from
the considered pro(cid:2)le, thus offering an interesting alternative
to formula-based merging operators [Baral et al., 1991; 1992;
Konieczny, 2000; Konieczny et al., 2002], which are typically
at least as hard from the complexity point of view and satisfy
less rationality postulates.
