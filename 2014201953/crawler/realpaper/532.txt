Abstract 

We  follow  Searle's  contention  that  speaking 
a  (natural)  language  is  to  engage  in  a  rule-
governed  form  of  behaviour,  and  that  those 
rules  are  conventional  (institutional)  rather 
than  natural  or  physical.  We  show  how  this 
analysis can also be used to specify rules of in(cid:173)
teraction  for systems of electronic  agents  com(cid:173)
municating  with  an  artificial  language.  We 
conclude that  using constitutive rules to define 
the  semantics  of an  agent  communication  lan(cid:173)
guage  not  only  distinguishes  agent  communi(cid:173)
cation  from  method  invocation,  but  also offers 
significant  computational  advantages  over  us(cid:173)
ing intentional states. 

Introduction 

1 
Wre  maintain  that  there  is  a  distinct  conceptual  and 
functional  difference  between  communication  using  an 
ACL  (Agent  Communication  Language)  and  communi(cid:173)
cation  using  an  API  (Application  Programmer  Inter(cid:173)
face).  Method invocation (via an API)  is essentially per(cid:173)
locutionary, that is, the  4speech act'  (the method call) is 
completely definable in terms of its perlocutionary effect, 
i.e.  the  further  consequences  or  effects  on  the  receiving 
(remote)  object.  This  property  makes  method  invoca(cid:173)
tion  practical  for  client-server  distributed  systems,  be(cid:173)
cause the execution of the remote method is transparent 
to the  (local)  caller - the data and  methods of the called 
object may just as easily have been on the same machine 
as on another connected to the network.  It also explains 
why the call semantics is so important:  the fundamental 
difference between idempotent and  at-most-once call se(cid:173)
mantics is whether or not the server is maintaining state. 
The communicating language itself is just a conventional 
device for securing a natural response. 

However,  according to  Searle's  institutional  theory of 
communication  [Searle,  1969], speaking a language is to 
engage in a rule-governed form of behaviour.  The seman(cid:173)
tic  structure  of the  language  is  given  by  a  conventional 
characterisation of sets of constitutive rules,  and 'speech 
acts'  are acts typically performed by uttering an expres(cid:173)
sion in accordance with those rules.  Thus the basic unit 

of  communication  is  the  illocutionary  act,  which  com(cid:173)
prises the type of the act (its illocutionary force:  stating, 
ordering,  promising,  etc.)  and its propositional content. 
The  meaning  of  each  unit  is  given  by  the  constitutive 
rules:  these  are  rules  that  both  define  the  forms  of  be(cid:173)
haviour  and  determine  what  that  behaviour  counts  as. 
Searle  contended  that  it  was  not  possible  to  reduce  the 
analysis  of  illocutionary  acts  to  perlocutionary  effects. 
Therefore there  is  a significant difference between  agent 
communication  and  object  invocation:  the  aim  of  this 
paper  is  to  make  that  difference  clear  and  suggest  how 
to  leverage  it  for  computational  advantage. 

In  [Searle,  1969],  the  characterisation  of  the  consti(cid:173)
tutive  rules  (in  particular  the  preparatory  and  sincerity 
conditions)  was expressed  in  terms of intentional states. 
While justifiable for natural language communication be(cid:173)
tween  humans,  we  believe  that  this  is  inappropriate  for 
open  systems  of  electronic  agents  and  has  misdirected 
standardisation  efforts,  e.g.  FIPA  (the  Foundation  for 
Intelligent  Physical  Agents).  However,  we  believe  that 
the  conventional  and  institutional  nature  of  communi(cid:173)
cation  can  still  be  used  to  specify  constitutive  rules  of 
interaction  for such  artificial systems. 

The  argument  advanced in this paper to support  that 
belief is  as  follows.  Section  2  gives  some  preliminaries, 
introducing  our  methodology  and  notation.  Section  3 
gives  some  illustrative  examples  to  motivate  the  speci(cid:173)
fication,  in  Section  4,  of some  basic  'standard'  commu(cid:173)
nicative  acts,  and  in  Section  5  of a  richer  form  of com(cid:173)
munication for conversations.  Section G concludes with a 
summary,  a brief review of further and related work,  and 
draws  some  conclusions.  In  particular,  the  emphasis  on 
the institutional perspective of Speech Act theory, rather 
than  on  agents'  beliefs,  desires,  or  intentions,  indicates 
that  a new  paradigm  in  designing  agent  communication 
languages offers significant  computational  advantages. 
2  Preliminaries 
In  this  section,  we  briefly  describe  our  methodological 
motivation  for  applying  the  ideas of Speech  Act  Theory 
to agent communication.  We then describe the notation 
used in the  rest  of the paper,  in particular,  the  abstract-
representation of agents and normative relations (in par(cid:173)
ticular  institutional  power,  permission  and  obligation).

2.1  Methodology 
We  operate  on  the  assumption  that  there  are  aspects 
of human  intelligence and society  than can  inform  algo(cid:173)
rithms,  architectures  and  data structures  for  the  design 
and  implementation  of 'better'  solutions  to software en(cid:173)
gineering  problems.  The process  begins with  the analy(cid:173)
sis of human  intelligence  and  the expression  of a theory 
(the process of theory  formation  in  philosophy,  psychol(cid:173)
ogy, linguistics, etc.  We don't presume to undertake this 
step ourselves).  The next step is a process we might call 
reification:  the  specification  of  that  theory  in  a  formal 
language.  There  are  two  problems  with  this  process: 
firstly,  information  loss,  as  parts  of  the  theory  which 
are intractable are eliminated;  and secondly,  complexity 
gain, as there may be theoretical assumptions which are 
easy  to state but  much  harder to  formalise.  As a conse(cid:173)
quence, the reified theory, or specification, is not a direct 
representation or literal specification of the original:  in(cid:173)
stead  it  has been inspired by that  t heory. 

The  process  is  marked  in  this  paper.  We  have  been 
analysing  both  Speech  Act  Theory  [Scarle,  1969],  Insti(cid:173)
tutional  Power  [Jones  and  Scrgot,  1996],  and  Conven(cid:173)
tional  Signalling  systems  [Jones,  2003].  The  resulting 
specification  of - or  rather,  proposal  for  a way of specif-
ing -  an  agent  communication language owes something 
to  both  accounts  of  communication  (in  particular,  we 
will refer to signals and agent's signalling actions, rather 
than speech acts)  but  also looks to the extant computer 
implementations described in [Artikis et a/., 2002].  (Such 
implementation  of the  specification  is  step  three  of our 
methodology, while step four is to embed that implemen(cid:173)
tation back in the human context in which it originated.) 

2.2  Notation:  Agent  Description 
We assume a domain with distinguished agents a, 6, etc., 
facts  (propositions) 
An 
agent  is  a  triple  comprising  (K, G, P),  respectively  the 
agent's knowledge base, goal base,  and planned actions. 
For  an individual  agent  a,  we write:

agent  a,  which  encapsulates  the 
agent's  deliberative state;

2.3  Notation:  'Logical'  Description 
The  characterisation  of  the  constitutive  rules  for  an 
agent  communication  language  requires  the  representa(cid:173)
tion of action,  'counts as'  and  institutional  power  [Jones 
and  Sergot,  1996],  and  dcontic  relations.  The  notation 
used is as follows. 

is  internally  consistent. 

i.e.  that 

For an agent's actions, both signalling acts and  (phys(cid:173)
ical)  acts  on  the  environment,  a  relativised  (to  agents) 
Â£  operator  is  used  (note  that 
here  is  the  proposition 
that 7r happened): 

a  sees  to  it  that 
a  sees  to  it  that 

is true 
is performed 

For reasons illustrated  in the first example of the next 
section, we also introduce a second relativised action op(cid:173)
erator C,  for  the  idea of 'capability  to  verify',  with  intu(cid:173)
itive reading  (we consider  the  formal reading later): 
means a  is  able to demonstrate  (give evi(cid:173)
dence)  that 
means  a  is  able  to  demonstrate  physical 
capability  to  perform   

(is  true) 

Central  to  the  [Jones,  2003]  analysis  of conventional 
signalling systems and the [Jones and Sergot, 1996] anal(cid:173)
ysis of institutional power is the idea of counts  as.  The 
idea  here  is  that  one  agent  seeing  to  it  that 
say, can 
count  as,  in certain contexts,  as another agent - or even 
the  institution  itself -  seeing  to  it  that 
This  notion 
was  formalised  in  [Jones  and  Sergot,  1996]  with  a  rela(cid:173)
tivised  (to  institutions)  conditional  connective 

: 

Such a formula is called  an  institutional power,  whereby 
a seeing to it  that  counts as (just as if) 1 sees to it that 
,  This is used to formalise Searle's constitutive rules of 
the  form  "X  counts  as  Y  in  context  C",  where  Searle's 
context  C  will  here  be  denoted  by  some  institution  /. 
We write: 

to identify  a 'named'  power  p denoting  a specific counts 
as formula. 

An agent a's permissions and obligations with respect 

to  an  institution  /  are  represented  by:

T wo  Illustrative  Examples 
3.1  Example  1:  T CP  Slowstart 
The  standard  TCP  specification  requires  implementa(cid:173)
tion  of an  algorithm  called  "slow start",  documented  in 
IETF  RFC2001  (cf.  [Stevens,  1996]).  The  specification 
of  the  algorithm  mandates  that,  on  the  sender's  side, 
the  first  transmission  consists  of just  one  packet.  If this 
is acknowledged successfully,  then the sender can trans(cid:173)
mit  two  packets.  The sender  then  continues  to  increase 
the number of packets transmitted  until  the network ca(cid:173)
pacity is reached  (packets are not acknowledged success(cid:173)
fully),  and  then  throttles  back.  This  ensures  that  no 
TCP  sender  overwhelms  a network. 

Let 

be  a  Windows  NT  server,  and  let 

be  the 
statement  ''I  (w)  implement  TCP  slow  start  algorithm 
as  specified  in  IETF  RFC2001".  Let  be the signalling 
system (i.e. agent communication language) in which the 
Assume a is used for communication 
signal q denotes

is the 
action  of transmitting the signal  denoting   

Now,  suppose  we  want  to  allow  agents,  in  particular 
servers  (TCP  senders),  to  assert  or  inform  other  agents 
that  they  implement  the  IETF  (institution  /)  standard 
specifications.  We  also  want  /  to  be  able to  inspect  and 
verify  that  servers  do  indeed  implement  the  standard 
specifications  correctly. 

So, we can write

meaning  that,  subjectively, 
from  w's  perspective, 
.  Sup(cid:173)
pose  then  that  makes  the  assertion,  in  a  that  </>.  As 
per  Searle  ("Counts  as  an  undertaking  that 
repre(cid:173)
sents  an  actual  state  of  affairs"  ([Searle,  1969]:  p.66)) 
we want  this  to count  as  a commitment,  in  the  context 
of  the  institution  /,  that  it  implements  the  slow  start 
algorithm  correctly.  We  interpret  commitment  here  as 
an obligation to be  able  to verify  that   

Now,  to capture the idea of an assertion as a commit(cid:173)
ment,  the  institution  /  has  the  following  as  one  of  its 
constitutive rules,  which  also  apply  to  any  other server: 

Thus  the  assertion,  in  7,  that  the  server  w  implements 
the  slow start  algorithm,  counts  as  an  obligation,  from 
the server to the institution, that this is a true statement. 
However,  and  more  importantly,  we  also  want  to  be 

able  to  make judgements of the  form cither: 

to say  that  according  to  the institution, 
(at  least  according  to  the institution)  true  (or  not). 

is objectively 

Certainly  this  demands  that 

as  a  required 
state,  but  also  that  w  be  capable  of demonstrating  that 
As it turns , because of a widespread bug in the 
slow start  implementation in  Windows  NT  servers,  </>  is 
not  a  true  (objectively  true)  statement  [Stevens,  1996]. 
Being  unable  to  verify  (if  demanded  to  do  so)  that  </>, 
w  would  be  in  violation  of its  obligation  if it  made  the 
assertion.  (Note we have set aside the practical problem 
of a program verifying properties  (correctness)  of itself.) 

3.2  Example  2:  Football  (Soccer) 
This  kind  of  example  is  common  in  the  literature  but 
worth  examining  again.  Consider  the  institution  F  of 
football  (soccer).  We define a  "goal"  is scored when the 
ball  has  crossed  a  painted  white  line  between  two  up(cid:173)
rights  and  under  a crossbar.  Then,  we can  examine the 
situation  at any given instant and  determine whether or 
not a goal  (according to F)  has been scored.  (In Searlc's 
terms,  the  fact  that  a ball  has  crossed  a  line  is  a brute 
fact,  the  fact  that  by  crossing  the  line  between  some 
sticks a goal has been scored,  is an institutional fact.) 
In  certain  games,  a  referee  is  given  the  power  to  ex(cid:173)
amine the situation  and decide whether or not  it fits the 
definition  of a  "goal".  If the  referee  signals  that  this  is 
the case,  then it is a goal  (in the sense that the score of 
one team is incremented, etc.).  Although a fairly coarse 
over-simplification,  we could  say that the referee  is em(cid:173)
powered by F to sec to it that goals are scored.  However, 
the referee is not permitted to signal  "goal"  (cannot ex(cid:173)
ercise  the  institutional  power)  unless  the  world-to-word 
fit is  such  that  the  situation  in  the  world  matches  the 
definition  of the  word.  So  if one  of the  players  sees  to 
it  that  the conditions  for  a  goal  are satisfied  (implicitly, 
according to the rules of football), then this counts as, in 
F,  as initiating the referee's permission to signal  "goal". 
Let us assume that the players  are permitted to signal 
"goal"  arbitrarily  (of course this is not strictly the case), 
but  because  they  are  not  empowered  to  create  goals,  if 
they do signal  "goal",  this does  not  count  as  a goal (in 
effect,  all they can do is  'claim'). 

So  let  us  have  agent  7'  who  has  the  power  of referee 
(i.e. agent 7* occupies the role of referee, which is granted 
certain  powers  by  institution  F).  Let 
be  the  action 
of transmitting  a  signal  in  the  signalling  system  (ACL) 
used by F, which denotes  "goal"  (e.g.,  whistling,  saying 
"goal",  etc.).  Then,  for  the  institution  F,  referee  agent 
r,  and  player  agents p,  we have  : 

A situation arose in the 1966 World Cup Final between 
England  and  Germany,  when  the  England  players  were 
claiming  a  goal  had  been  scored.  The  England  players 
were  permitted  to  signal  "goal",  but  not  being  empow(cid:173)
ered,  these  signals  did  not  count  as  goals.  The  referee 
was  so  empowered,  so when  he  signalled  "goal",  it  did 
count  as  a  goal  -  even  though  a  "goal"  had  not  been 
scored.  The  problem,  according  to  the  characterisation 
above,  was  that  the referee was exercising  a power  that 
in  fact  he  was  not  permitted  to.  At  this  point,  the  ref(cid:173)
eree should have been sanctioned  according to the rules 
of F:  but  this  too  is  a  subject  for  further  work.  How(cid:173)
ever,  as we see in Section 5, this is the kind of situation 
we  expect  to  encounter  in  future  multi-agents  systems, 
where  agents  have  powers  to  see  to  it  that  institutional 
facts are true,  but  have constraints on their permissions 
or occasions when to exercise that  power.

4  Single  Signalling  Acts 
The two illustrative examples of the previous section in(cid:173)
dicate  typical  examples  of the  kind  of meaning  we  seek 
for  agent's  illocutionary  acts. 
In  the  first  example,  it 
was  that  the  assertion  counted  as  an  undertaking  that 
the propositional content was true (and that the asserter 
could  verify  that  it  was  true);  in  the  second  example, 
that  the  declaration  counted  as  the  insitution seeing  to 
that  the  corresponding institutional  fact  was  true. 

Motivated  by  this,  in  this  section,  we  specify  a  set 
of constitutive  rules  for single,  'one off'  signals,  i.e.  sig(cid:173)
nalling  actions  not  anticipating  a  reply.  The  specific 
context  for  this  argument  is  as  follows.  For  "an  agent 
communicates by message passing", i.e. a communicative 
action  performed  by  an  agent,  we  are  assuming  a com(cid:173)
putational  model  involving  the  point-to-point  transmis(cid:173)
sion (from agent a to agent b) of 'information structures' 
representing  these  messages.  'Saying'  and  'hearing'  arc 
the  results  of,  respectively,  writing  to  and  reading  from 
some channel  (e.g.  a TCP/IP socket connection),  or the 
consequences of remote  method  invocation  (RMI)  using 
constitutive rules rather  than  a conventional  device. 

For the operational context,  we mean an open system 
as  indicated  in  [Artikis  et  a/.,  2002],  whereby:  no  sin(cid:173)
gle  agent  has  universal  knowledge  of the  entire  system, 
agents may have conflicting goals,  internal architectures 
are  not  known,  local  states  are  individually  consistent 
but may be globally inconsistent, and there is no central(cid:173)
ized  authority  or  control  (of knowledge  and  behaviour). 
On  the issue of decentralization, we take the position of 
local autonomy over goals,  decisions and state,  but  that 
all communication is institutional  [Searle,  1999]. 

Assume for the application that the agents are engaged 
in  information  trading or web services.  We  assume  that 
the  application  will  include  finding  and  requesting  ser(cid:173)
vices, and finding and supplying information.  Thus there 
will  be  some  individual  message  exchanges  (assertives, 
directives,  etc.)  and  some  structured  exchanges  (e.g. 
contract  nets  and  auctions).  For  each  individual  sig(cid:173)
nalling  act,  we  give  the  required  form  (of propositional 
content  arid  signalling  content),  the  conventional  inter(cid:173)
pretation  of the  signal,  and  the  institutional  powers  (if 
any)  associated  with  the  signal  itself.  Note  that  this  is 
an  external  specification:  so  the  conventional  interpre(cid:173)
tation  indicates  that,  in  the  context  of  this  particular 
institution,  if an agent  wants  to convey a certain  mean(cid:173)
ing, then  (by convention)  it uses a particular signal;  and 
if an agent witnesses a particular signal, then (by conven(cid:173)
tion) a certain meaning is conveyed.  We consider four of 
the five types of illocutionary  point  identified in  [Searle, 
1999]:  assertive (assert and inform), directive (command 
and request),  commissive and declarative.

Note that there might be some minor objections to the 
characterisation of the constitutive rules for the given il(cid:173)
locutionary act types.  However, recall that this is an  ar(cid:173)
tificial system of communication, that is being designed. 
It is not intended to be a formal characterisation of a pre(cid:173)
existing system of communication,  i.e.  natural language, 
although  it  draws  its  inspiration  from  that  source.  If in 
turn the inspiration is not respecting the intuition,  then 
it  is  cas}'  enough  to  substitute  signaLacLl  for  assert, 
siyndLact-2 for  inform,  and  so  on,  as  the  software  will 
process the messages in just the same way and according 
to  the same constitutive  rules. 

Searle's  [Searle,  1969]  formulation  of  rules  in  speech 
act  theory  included  what  he  called  preparatory  condi(cid:173)
tions  and  sincerity  conditions.  Preparatory  conditions 
were  extant  circumstances  required  for  a  speech  act  to 
be  a  valid  act  of  the  associated  illocutionary  type;  the 
sincerity condition was a 'psychological' expression asso(cid:173)
ciated with the speech  act. 

Our agents do not have psychological states, but given 
the  notation  of Section  2  it  is  not  uninteresting  to  con(cid:173)
sider  putative  sincerity  conditions  expressed  in  the  sig(cid:173)
nals  defined  above.  For  example,  if  we  added  to  in(cid:173)
form  the  preparatory  condition  -i(Aa  h  (At,  h  </>)),  and 
the  sincerity  condition  Aa  h  </>,  then  these  are  effec(cid:173)
tively  FIPA  inform  Feasibility  Preconditions  FP1  and 
FP2  [FIPA,  1997],  while  the conventional  interpretation 
is essentially the intended RE  (Rational Effect).  Thus it 
is straightforward,  within  the  framework of constitutive 
rules,  to  get  the  current  FIPA  ACL  semantics  to  'drop 
out' as a special case.

5  Conversations:  An  Auction  Protocol 
In  this  section,  we  apply  the  idea  of  constitutive  rules 
to  a  conversation,  based  on  a  variant  of  the  English 
Auction  protocol  [Venkatraman  and  Singh,  1999].  One 
observation  from  the  analysis  here  is  that  specifica(cid:173)
tion  of  constitutive  rules  for  an  ACL  must  be  sensi(cid:173)
tive  to  time  and  predication,  cf.  [Artikis  et  a/.,  2002; 
Sergot, 2003]. 

An informal description of the auction is:  the auction(cid:173)
eer opens the auction for goods g  at price p\  bidders are 
empowered  to bid  for g  at  price p;  after receiving a  bid, 
the  auctioneer  is  empowered  to  announce  a  new  price 
and  if  there  is  no  bid  at  the  new  price,  the 

auctioneer  has  the  power  to  accept  a bid  at  price p. 

There  are  also  other  rules  that  govern  the  conduct  of 
an  auction,  namely  that,:  offering  specific  goods  g  for 
auction  implies  that  the  auctioneer  either  owns  or  is  li(cid:173)
censed  to sell g\  making a bid of p for p implies  that  the 
bidder owns p;  bidding p more than once and  bidding a 
price  lower  than  the  announced  price p  arc  meaningless 
actions;  and  the  auctioneer  is  not  empowered  to  accept 
two bids for  the same g. 

One way to formalise this protocol is to specify:  the in(cid:173)
stitutional  powers of the auctioneer and the bidders;  the 
assertions  implicit  in  making  announcements  and  bids; 
and  the changing permissions of each  participant  as  the 
protocol progresses which determine whether or not they 
are  allowed  to exercise  their  powers.  There  are  three il-
locutionary acts:  announce,  bid and accept, with propo-
sitional  content  goods  g  (lot  number)  and  price  p.  We 
assume,  that all communications are broadcast, with the 
intended recipient  b of accept messages explicitly identi(cid:173)
fied  in some way. 

In  general,  the  assertive  force  implicit  in  the  illocu-

tionary  acts is given  by: 

The  institutional  conditions  element  of  the  constitu(cid:173)
tive rules are given by the following institutional powers. 
Note that these are unlike some of the institutional pow(cid:173)
ers  previously  discussed  in  this  paper,  for  two  reasons. 
Firstly,  these  are  'power  schema1,  in  the  sense  that  the 
actions  of other  agents will  instantiate specific  instances 
of each schema;  and secondly, because they are transient 
rather  than  permanent,  and  each specific  instance  is ei(cid:173)
ther initiated or terminated under certain circumstances. 

The  power of a bidder  is  given  by: 

while  the  auctioneer  has  two  powers:  firstly  the  power 
to make announcements, by announcing an auction, and 
secondly  the  power  to  make  contracts,  by  accepting  a 
bid: 

/Pow  announce   

announce 
/Pow  accept l  

announcement 

 

accept(B, G,  P) 

contract 

 

Now the way it works is that if an agent has the power 
and performs the action, then it will count as seeing to it 
that  the corresponding  instituional  fact  is true.  The in(cid:173)
stitutional  fact  in  turn  initiates or  terminate other  pow(cid:173)
ers  (so  each  agent  in  effect  has  the  power  to  empower 
other  agents).  If,  initially,  /Powaannounce(<7,p),  then: 

 

for all b 

for all b' 
some b" 

jT*ow hbid(g, p) 
/Pow aannounce 

/Pow a accept (b, g, p) 
/Powj/ bid(g, p') 

...  initiating 
...  terminating 
b signals  bid(#,p)  results in  ... 
/Pow u announce   
...initiating 
...  terminating 
iPow b>bid(g,p) 
...  terminating  /Pow a  accept 
;Pow a accept  
...initiating 
a  signals  accept(/;, g,p)  results  in  ... 
...  terminating 
...  terminating 
Note  [Artikis  et  a/.,  2002]  formalised  a  specification 
of  the  contract-net  protocol  in  terms  of  which  powers, 
etc., were initated and which were terminated by specific 
actions  (which  allowed  for  an  event  calculus  specifica(cid:173)
tion and direct implementation of the protocol).  [Sergot, 
2003]  also contains an analysis of an  auction protocol. 
What's  missing  from  the  formalisation  of  conversa(cid:173)
tional  illocutionary  acts,  as  opposed  to  the  signalling 
acts  of  the  previous  section,  is  the  conventional  inter(cid:173)
pretation  (that  these  acts  count  as  attempts  to  affect 
computational  states  in  some  way). 
It  is  not  entirely 
clear what these should be  (e.g.  for announce,  to inform 
b that g  is for sale,  to induce b to make a bid,  or to  in(cid:173)
dicate  its  intention  to  sell  g  once  a  buyer  is  found);  or 
indeed  that such rules are adding anything useful in this 
context.  We  leave  this  for  further  investigation. 

In addition,  we could specify  that  agents are only per(cid:173)
mitted to exercise their power,  as  an  auctioner or a bid(cid:173)
der,  if they  either  own  the  goods  g  or  the  bidding price 
p respectively.  In  this way,  we could  circumvent  the im(cid:173)
plicit  assertive force in  the announce  and  bid  signals,  by 
requiring  that  agents  seek  permission  to  sell  goods  or 
offer bids,  and  are subject to sanction if they create con(cid:173)
tracts  without  permission,  which  they  cannot  honour. 
6  Summary  and  Conclusions 
Searle  [Searle,  1969]  defined  the semantics of illocution(cid:173)
ary  acts  in  terms  of  the  conventional  realization  of  se(cid:173)
ries  of sets  of constitutive  rules,  and  that  a  meaningful 
speech  act  was  performed  by  uttering  an  expression  in 
accordance  with  those  rules.  The  constitutive  rule  sets 
proposed ([Searle,  1969]:p66-67) contained several condi(cid:173)
tions,  including  the  propositional  content,  preparatory, 
sincerity  and  essential  conditions.  However,  a  number 
of these rules were concerned with 'psychological1 states, 
and  the  attempted  formalization  of such  rules  in  multi(cid:173)
modal BDI logics are far from computationally tractable. 
In this paper,  we have proposed to use Searle's theory 
of constitutive  rules  to  define  a  semantics  of illocution(cid:173)
ary  acts  (signals)  for an agent  communication language.

The set  of conditions,  for  a wide series  of act  types,  in(cid:173)
cludes the propositional content and form of a signalling 
act, the conventional interpretation (of intended perlocu-
tionary effect), the institutional conditions (expressed as 
a counts as formula)  requiring institutional powers,  and 
(in  conversations)  what  deontic  states  are  initiated  or 
terminated  by  the performance of the signalling act. 

There  is,  however,  more  work  that  is  required.  We 
have characterised  the formalism used in Section 2  as a 
'notation'.  Ideally, the agent abstraction would define an 
operational  model,  which  would  be  directly  executable, 
and  the  'logical'  representation would be complete.  For 
an executable operational model, we need an operational 
semantics,  and  for  this  purpose  we  are  investigating  la(cid:173)
belled transition systems.  A compiler for such rules, with 
an explicit  link to  (an implementation of)  the agent  ab(cid:173)
straction,  could then be considered. 

For  the  logical  model,  we  require  (at  least)  a seman(cid:173)
tics of the C operator.  We recognize this is problematic, 
but for the kind of applications in which we axe interested 
(where assertions of the forms  "I have this right",  "I rep(cid:173)
resent this agency",  "I can perform this service"  are an(cid:173)
ticipated) we feel something of this kind is required.  We 
have interpreted Searle's meaning of an assertion  ("com(cid:173)
mitment  to  the  truth  of 
as an obligation  to be able 
and  this  is  not  a matter  of merely seeing  to 
to  verify 
it  that 
However,  the work-around suggested  in 
the previous section could eliminate the C  operator. 

Moreover,  there  axe  many  open  questions,  some  of 
which  have  already  been  indicated.  The  nature  of  the 
relationship  between  electronic  institutions  and  deontic 
states of agents needs to be further elaborated, as this is 
central to definition of the communication model.  Many 
problems  in  Section  5  stemmed  from  trying  to  analyse 
dynamic  phenomena  in  an  essentially  static  formalism, 
so an explicit treatment and representation of time, link(cid:173)
ing  to  [Artikis  et  a/.,  2002;  Sergot,  2003],  is  required. 
The  representation  of  contracts,  from  where  this  work 
originated,  also needs to be refined. 

Defining  ACL  semantics  based  on  Speech  Act  theory 
was  first  proposed  for  both  KQML  [Labrou  and  Finin, 
1998]  and  FIPA  [FIPA,  1997],  and  given  in  terms  of 
an axiomatic characterisation of intentional BDI agents. 
We  would  argue  that  the  emphasis  on  the  intentional 
states rather than the institutional nature of the commu(cid:173)
nication  has  omitted  the  most  important  component  of 
the theory.  [Greaves et al, 2001]  proposed an alternative 
model, using the idea of conversation policies, which de(cid:173)
fine fine-grained constraints on ACL  usage.  Another al(cid:173)
ternative involves proposals primarily based on the idea 
of  commitments,  e.g.  [Venkatraman  and  Singh,  1999; 
Colombetti,  2001],  while  Jones  [Jones,  2003]  proposes 
a  conventional  account  of natural  language  speech  acts 
based  on  the  intentional  exploitation  of signalling  sys(cid:173)
tems.  Motivated  in  part  by  the  latter  work,  we  have 
returned to Speech Act theory and attempted to charac(cid:173)
terise  constitutive  rules  for  a  system  of communication 
between  'autonomous'  agents  governed  by  an electronic 
institution.  Our intuition is that the interaction between 

this  work  and  that  of conversation  policies  offers  some 
intriguing  potential  for  further  development. 

In conclusion,  we believe that  we have  a basis  for de(cid:173)
signing ACLs, and giving a formal characterization of the 
semantics  of communicative  acts  which  is  powerful,  ex(cid:173)
pressive  and  flexible.  Most  importantly,  it  demonstrates 
the fundamental conceptual and functional difference be(cid:173)
tween  language-based  communication  and  method  in(cid:173)
vocation,  and  justifies  why  agent-based  systems  offer  a 
unique  advantage over object-oriented  ones.
