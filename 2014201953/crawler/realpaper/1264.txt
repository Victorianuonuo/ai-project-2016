It  is 
appropriate  to  note  two  basic  concepts 
that  are 
fundamental  to  understanding  the  model.  These 
model  concepts  are  a  simulated  clock  and  a  window, 
and  should  be  f a m i l i ar  to  those  acquainted  w i th 
the  EPAM  model21  of  verbal  l e a r n i n g.  The  clock 
is  e s s e n t i a l ly  a  cumulative  record  of  the  time 
required  by  the  various  memory  processes.  Each 
time  a  process 
incremented  by  an  amount  of  time  associated  w i th 
that  process.  The  time  base  simulated 
model  is  milliseconds.  The  window,  a  series  of

presented  (which  is  determined  by  examining 
the  window  to  see  if  something  new  has

the  items  already  in  STM  are 
rehearsed  during  the  i n t e r i t em  i n t e r v a l. 
Rehearsal  consists  of  r e t r i e v i ng  components 

of  an  item  from  an  STM  c e l l,  recognizing 
the  item  by  finding  a  match  in  LTM,  and  then 
updating  the  component  substructures  in  STM. 
Updating  involves  resetting  the  time  tag  to 
the  current  value  of  the  clock  and  changing 
the  decay  function  so  that  the  component 
decays  at  a  slower  r a t e.  Rehearsal  during

and  is  recognized,  control  is 
transferred  to 
a  respond  process  that  attempts  to  r e c a ll 
the  items.  The  respond  routine  works  much 
l i ke 
the  rehearsal  routine  in  that  components 
are  retrieved  from  STM  and  recognized  as  an 
item  in  LTM.  An  additional  process  in 
responding  involves  outputting  the  item  to 
the  environment--simulating  S's  w r i t i ng  or 
verbalizing 

the  item. 

8.  When  r e c a ll  of  a  sequence  is  complete, 
the  STM  structures  representing  that 
sequence  are  erased.  A  new  sequence  is 
then  begun  w i th  nothing  in  STM.  Thus,  at

the  name  of  the  c e ll

functions)  of  the  next  item  are  stored.  This

responding  the  model  attempts  to  go  from  one 
item  to  the  next  by  r e t r i e v i ng  the  location  of 
the  next  item. 
This  r e t r i e v al  e f f o rt  is  simply 
a  matter  of  using  the  decay  function  specified

the  model  w i ll  randomly

comes  of  these  mistakes  are.  A  f i r st  type  of
