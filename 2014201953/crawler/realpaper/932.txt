Abstract

We consider competition between sellers offering
similar items in concurrent online auctions through
a mediating auction institution, where each seller
must set its individual auction parameters (such as
the reserve price) in such a way as to attract buyers.
We show that in the case of two sellers with asym-
metric production costs, there exists a pure Nash
equilibrium in which both sellers set reserve prices
above their production costs. In addition, we show
that, rather than setting a reserve price, a seller can
further improve its utility by shill bidding (i.e., bid-
ding as a buyer in its own auction). This shill bid-
ding is undesirable as it introduces inefﬁciencies
within the market. However, through the use of
an evolutionary simulation, we extend the analyt-
ical results beyond the two-seller case, and we then
show that these inefﬁciencies can be effectively re-
duced when the mediating auction institution uses
auction fees based on the difference between the
auction closing and reserve prices.

1 Introduction

Online markets are becoming increasingly prevalent and ex-
tend to a wide variety of areas such as e-commerce, Grid com-
puting, recommender systems, and sensor networks. To date,
much of the existing research has focused on the design and
operation of individual auctions or exchanges for allocating
goods and services. In practice, however, similar items are
typically offered by multiple independent sellers that com-
pete for buyers and set their own terms and conditions (such
as their reserve price and the type and duration of the auction)
within an institution that mediates between buyers and sellers.
Examples of such institutions include eBay, Amazon and Ya-
hoo!, where at any point in time multiple concurrent auctions
with different settings are selling similar objects, resulting in
strong competition1.

∗This research was undertaken as part of the EPSRC funded

project on Market-Based Control (GR/T10664/01).

1To illustrate the scale of this competition, within eBay alone
close to a thousand auctions for selling Apple’s iPod nano were run-
ning worldwide at the time of writing.

Given this competition, a key research question is how a
seller should select their auction settings in order to best at-
tract buyers and so increase their expected proﬁts.
In this
paper, we consider this issue in terms of setting the seller’s
reserve price (since the role of the reserve price has received
attention in both single isolated auctions and also in cases
where sellers compete). In particular, we extend the existing
analysis by considering how sellers may improve their proﬁt
by shill bidding (i.e., bidding within their own auction as a
means of setting an implicit reserve price). We do so analyti-
cally in the case of two sellers, and then develop an evolution-
ary simulation to enable us to solve the general case of mul-
tiple sellers. Moreover, since shill bidding is generally un-
desirable (it undermines trust in the institution and decreases
overall market efﬁciency), we then extend our evolutionary
simulation to investigate how the institution can deter shill
bidding through the use of appropriate auction fees. More
speciﬁcally, we make the following contributions:

• We analytically describe the seller’s equilibrium strate-
gies for setting reserve prices for the two-seller case, and
we advance the current state-of-the-art by ﬁnding Nash
equilibria by iteratively discretising the search space.
We show that, although no pure strategies exist when the
sellers are symmetric, these can be found if production
costs differ sufﬁciently between the two sellers.

• For the ﬁrst time, we investigate shill bidding within a
setting of competing sellers. To this end, we derive ana-
lytical expressions for the seller’s expected utility when
sellers shill bid. Using these expressions, we show that,
without auction fees, a seller can considerably beneﬁt by
shill bidding when faced with competition.

• We introduce an evolutionary simulation technique that
allows us to extend the analytical approach described
above to the general case where an arbitrary number
of sellers compete, and we benchmark this approach
against our analytical results.

• Finally, we extend our evolutionary simulation, and use
it to compare various types of auction fees. We evalu-
ate the ability of different fees to deter shill bidding and
quantify their impact on market efﬁciency. We show the
novel results that within a market with competing sell-
ers, auction fees based on the difference between the
payment and the reserve price are more effective than

ond, we introduce a mediator that charges commission fees to
the seller for running the auction, and we investigate the case
that sellers submit shill bids. Such shill bidding has previ-
ously been researched within isolated auctions [Wang et al.,
2004; Kauffman and Wood, 2005]. However, our work is
the ﬁrst that considers shill bidding as a result of sellers hav-
ing to compete. Finally, we investigate how auction fees can
best be used to reduce a seller’s incentive to shill bid. This
is important since in many auctions shill bidding is illegal,
but since it is hard to detect, it is difﬁcult to prevent in prac-
tice. Again, whilst using auction fees to deter shill bidding
has been considered in isolated auctions [Wang et al., 2004],
here we investigate this issue in the context of competing sell-
ers, and also consider how the auction fees affect the overall
efﬁciency of the market.

Finally, we note that our work is also closely related to
recent research on simultaneous auctions [Anthony and Jen-
nings, 2003; Byde et al., 2002]. However, unlike our case,
this research does not explicitly consider that the sellers need
to tune their auction parameters such as the reserve price in
order to attract buyers.

3 Model of Competing Sellers

The model of competing sellers proceeds in four stages (see
ﬁgure 1). First, the mediator (an institution such as eBay or
Yahoo!
that runs the auctions) announces the auction fees
to the sellers. The sellers then simultaneously post their re-
serve prices in the second stage. In the third stage, the buyers
simultaneously select an auction (or, equivalently, a seller)
based on the observed reserve prices. In the ﬁnal stage, the
buyers (and possibly the sellers who are shill bidding) sub-
mit bids and the auctions are executed concurrently. We now
detail the three main components of our model:

3.1 The Mediator

The mediator decides on the auction fees and determines the
market rules or mechanism to be used in the auctions. In our
current model, we use a second-price sealed bid (or Vickrey)
auction, in which the highest bidder wins but pays the price
of the second-highest bidder.

3.2 The Sellers

A seller has the option to openly declare a minimum or re-
serve price. In addition, the seller is able to shill bid. If the
shill bid wins the auction, effectively no sale is made, but a
seller is still required to pay the auction fees.

3.3 The Buyers

A buyer ﬁrst selects a single auction based on the announced
reserve price, and then bids in the selected auction. Note that
buyers are unaware that sellers shill bid. The bidding strat-
egy is not affected by the reserve price; it is a weakly dom-
inant strategy to bid the true value [Krishna, 2002]. On the
other hand, the reserve price is an important factor in deter-
mining which auction the buyer should choose. To this end,
the buyer’s equilibrium strategies for selecting an auction are
detailed in the next section.

deterring shill bidding and increasing market efﬁciency.

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2
describes related work in this area and section 3 describes
our model of competing sellers. Section 4 analyses the buyer
and seller strategies, and identiﬁes the cases for which a pure
Nash equilibrium exists, in the case of two sellers. Section 5
introduces an evolutionary simulation that allows us to solve
the general case of multiple sellers. In section 6 we compare
auction fees, and ﬁnally, section 7 concludes.

2 Related Work
McAfee [1993] was the ﬁrst to consider mechanism design
and reserve prices in the context of competing sellers.
In
his paper, sellers can choose any direct mechanism and these
mechanisms are conducted for multiple periods with dis-
counted future payoffs. However, he assumed that (i) a seller
ignores his inﬂuence on the proﬁts offered to buyers by other
sellers, and (ii) that expected proﬁts in future periods are
invariant to deviation of a seller in the current period. As
McAfee notes, these assumptions are only reasonable in the
case of inﬁnitely many players. In contrast, we consider the
more realistic ﬁnite case, with a small numbers of buyers and
sellers, where strategic considerations become important.

Subsequent papers have relaxed some of McAfee’s strong
assumptions. In Burguet and S´akovics [1999], a unique equi-
librium strategy for the buyers in the two-seller case is de-
rived (see also section 4.1). In addition, they show that there
always exists an equilibrium for the sellers, but this cannot be
a symmetric one in pure strategies. They are unable to fully
characterize the mixed equilibrium, but argue that sellers set a
reserve price above their own valuation of the item. This anal-
ysis is generalised for a large number of sellers in Hernando-
Veciana [2005], where it is shown that reserve prices tend to
production costs in the limit case for asymmetric sellers.

Our work extends these results in a number of ways. First,
we are able to locate pure Nash equilibria for the asymmet-
ric seller setting (analytically in the case of two sellers and

4 Theoretical Analysis: Two Sellers

A complete analysis of equilibrium behaviour and market
efﬁciency for the complete model is intractable [McAfee,
1993]. Therefore, in this section, we analyse a simpliﬁed ver-
sion with two sellers and no auction fees (in section 5 we
consider the general case of more than two sellers and in sec-
tion 6 we address the complete model). We assume that there
are N risk neutral buyers, each of whom requires just one
item. Each buyer has valuation v independently drawn from
a commonly known cumulative distribution F with density
f and support [0, 1]. Each risk neutral seller offers one item
for sale, has production costs xi, and decides upon a reserve
price ri and shill bid si. Production costs are only incurred
in case the item is sold. The preferences of buyers and sell-
ers are described by von Neumann and Morgenstern utility
functions.

4.1 Buyer Equilibrium Behaviour

The buyers’ behaviour for two sellers has been analysed
in [Burguet and S´akovics, 1999]. A rational buyer with val-
uation v < r1 will not attend any auction. Furthermore, if
r1 < v < r2, the buyer will always go to seller 1. The inter-
esting case occurs when v > r2. In a symmetric Nash equi-
librium, there is a unique cut-off point 1 ≥ w ≥ r2 where
buyers with v < w will always go to seller 1, and buyers with
v ≥ w will randomize equally between the two auctions2.
The cut-off point w is exactly where a buyer’s expected util-
ity is equal for both auctions, and is thus found by solving:

r1F(r1, w)N −1

+ (N − 1)

(cid:2) w

r1

yF(y, w)N −2dF (y)

= r2F(w, w)N −1

where F(y, w) = F (y) + [1 − F (w)]/2. Given this cut-off
point, we can now calculate the sellers’ expected revenue.

4.2 Seller Equilibrium Behaviour

To calculate the equilibrium behaviour of the sellers, we de-
rive a general expression for the sellers’ expected utility. This
is calculated by considering the probability of one of three
events occurring: (i) no bidders having valuations above the
reserve price and the item does not sell, (ii) only one bidder
having a valuation above the reserve price and the item sells
at the reserve price, or (iii) two or more bidders having valua-
tions above the reserve price and the item sells at a price equal
to the second highest valuation. Thus, the expected utility of
seller i who has a production cost of xi and sets a reserve
price of ri is:
Ui(ri, xi) = N (ri − xi)G(ri)(1 − G(ri))N −1

(cid:2) 1

+ N (N − 1)

r1

(xi − y)G (cid:2)(y)G(y)(1 − G(y))N −2dy (1)

2In the case of multiple sellers, the buyers’ equilibrium strategy
yields a sequence of cut-off points [Hernando-Veciana, 2005]. How-
ever, in this case, the sellers’ equilibrium strategy can not be solved
analytically, thus in section 5.1 we present an evolutionary simula-
tion approach to ﬁnd this equilibrium.

where G(y) is the probability that a bidder is present in the
auction and that this bidder has a valuation greater than y.

Now, in the auction with no competing sellers, we have the
standard result that G(y) = 1 − F (y) and G (cid:2)(y) = −f (y).
However, for two competing sellers, we must account for the
fact that the number and valuation of the bidders in the auc-
tion is determined by the bidders’ cut-off point w. Thus, for
sellers (with the lower reserve price) this probablity is given
by:

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

G1(y) =

and for seller 2, by:

1+F (w)

y ≥ w

G2(y) =

1−F (w)

2

1−F (y)

2

y < w
y ≥ w

(2)

(3)

Thus, the sellers’ expected utility depends on the reserve price
of both sellers and the equilibrium behaviour is complex. We
now apply this result to three different cases: (i) where both
sellers declare public reserve prices, (ii) where one seller de-
clares a public reserve price and the other submits a shill bid,
and (iii) where both sellers shill bid3.

Both Sellers Announce Public Reserve Prices.
In this case, the equilibrium strategy of each seller is given
by a Nash equilibrium at which each seller’s reserve price
is a utility maximising best response to the reserve price of
the competing seller. When x1 = x2, no pure strategy Nash
equilibrium exists [Burguet and S´akovics, 1999]. However,
when the sellers have sufﬁciently different production costs,
we ﬁnd that a pure Nash equilibrium exists where the reserve
price of both sellers is higher than their production costs. We
ﬁnd this equilibrium numerically by iteratively discretising
the space of possible reserve prices. That is, for all possible
values of r1 and r2 that satisfy the conditions x1 ≤ r1 ≤ 1
and r1 ≤ r2 ≤ 1, we calculate w and hence the expected
utility of the two sellers. We then search these reserve price
combinations to ﬁnd the values of r∗
2 that represent
the utility maximising best responses to one another. By it-
erating the process and using a ﬁner discretisation at each
stage, we are able to calculate the Nash equilibrium to any
degree of precision, and we can conﬁrm that this is indeed
the pure Nash equilibrium by checking that the utility of
seller 2 cannot be further improved by undercutting seller 1
(i.e. U2(r2, x2) < U2(r∗
1 ). Figure 2 shows
an example of the utilities of each seller at this equilibrium
(in this case x1 = 0.25, x2 = 0.50 and N = 10). Note
that in this case there is clearly no advantage for seller 2 to
undercut seller 1, and the reserve prices of r1 = 0.49 and
r2 = 0.63 represent a stable Nash equilibrium from which
neither seller will unilaterally deviate. Figure 3 shows a plot
indicating the range of asymmetric cases (i.e., cases where
x1 (cid:6)= x2) in which we ﬁnd a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.

1 and r∗

3When a seller shill bids, the declared reserve price has no ad-
ditional beneﬁt. Thus we assume they declare no reserve price (or,
equivalently, declare a zero reserve price). In the next section, how-
ever, we relax this assumption.

As can be seen, the symmetric case is very much a special
case, and the majority of possible production cost combina-
tions yield unique pure strategy Nash equilibria, at which we
can calculate the seller’s expected utility.

One Seller Shill Bids.
Rather than announce a public reserve price, either seller may
choose to announce a reserve price of zero to attract bidders,
and then submit a shill bid to prevent the item from selling
at too low a price. Thus, the seller who does not shill bid
(seller 2 since r2 will be greater than r1) should declare a re-
serve price that is a best response to the zero reserve price an-
nounced by the bidder who does shill bid. This reserve price
is simply given by the value of r2 that maximises U2(r2, x2),
given that we calculate G2(y) as in equation (3) and take
r1 = 0 in order to calculate w. Given the best response re-
serve price of seller 2, and the resulting value of w, we can
also calculate the shill bid that seller 1 should submit in order
to maximise its own expected utility. By substituting s1 for
r1 in equation 1, and using G1(y) as given in equation (2), we
ﬁnd the shill bid that maximises U1(s1, x1).

Both Sellers Shill Bid.
Finally, when both sellers declare a zero reserve price and
shill bid, the bidders will randomise equally between either
auction, since there is no reserve price information to guide
their decision. Thus we ﬁnd the equilibrium shill bids of both
sellers by again substituting si for ri in equation 1 and hence
ﬁnding the value of si that maximises Ui(si, xi) when w = 0.

Table 1 shows an example of the resulting four strategy com-

binations as a normal form game (in this case N = 10,
x1 = 0.25, and x2 = 0.5). Note that both sellers have domi-
nant strategies to submit shill bids (this result holds in general
in the absence of auction fees). At this equilibrium, seller 2
achieves its maximum possible utility. However, seller 1 re-
ceives more when neither seller shill bids and would thus pre-
fer a mechanism that deters shill bidding.

5 Empirical Analysis: Beyond Two Sellers
In this section, we describe and validate an evolutionary sim-
ulation that allows us to simultaneously solve both the buyers’
and sellers’ equilibrium strategies in the more general setting
beyond the two-seller case. Since our goal is to use this evo-
lutionary simulation to compare auction fees, we also relax
the assumption that a seller places a zero reserve price when
shill bidding. This assumption was reasonable in the previous
section and allowed us to derive analytic results. However, in
the presence of auction fees we require that sellers are able to
trade-off between the reserve price that they set, and the value
of the shill bid that they submit.

We chose an evolutionary simulation, or more precisely
evolutionary algorithms, since they provide a powerful
metaphor for learning in economics. In the past, they have
been successfully applied to settings where, like the one we
consider here, game-theoretic solutions are not available [An-
thony and Jennings, 2003; Bohte et al., 2004].

In the following, M refers to the number of sellers in the

game, and N to the number of buyers.

5.1 The Evolutionary Simulation
Our simulation works as follows. The evolutionary algorithm
(EA) maintains two populations, one with seller and one with
buyer strategies. A seller strategy determines both the shill
bid and reserve price for each auction4. As each of the M

4Note that, although a seller always places a shill bid, setting this
value below or equal to the reserve price is equivalent to not shill
bidding. Moreover, the simulation has the option to disable the shill
bid or the reserve price, which is used in Section 5.2 to validate the
simulation results against the analytical solutions.

denoting 95% conﬁdence intervals) for the competing sellers game with varying number of buyers for the cases where none,
one or both sellers shill bids (with production costs x1 = 0.25 and x2 = 0.50). Experimental results are averaged over 30 runs.

sellers can have different production costs affecting the op-
timal values, a strategy contains separate reserve prices and
shill bids for each seller in the game (thus the number of sell-
ers M affects the size of the strategies, but not the size of
the seller population, which is independent of M ). A buyer
strategy determines the cut-off points for selecting one of the
sellers as described in section 4.1. The buyer and seller strate-
gies are encoded using real values within the range [0, 1].

The strategies are evaluated as follows. At each genera-
tion, M seller and N buyer strategies are randomly selected
from the populations and compete against one another in a
number of games. Although each strategy in the seller popu-
lation contains the reserve price and shill bid for all sellers in
the game, it is important that they are evaluated by compet-
ing against different strategies. Otherwise, a strategy would
maximise the payoff in self-play, and would not be encour-
aged to reach the Nash equilibrium solution. When a game
is played, each of the M selected strategies takes on the role
of one of the sellers in the game. In order to evaluate each
strategy as a whole, the game is played several times with the
same strategies but with different roles for the seller strate-
gies. The average payoff in these games then determines the
strategies’ ﬁtness. This process is repeated until all strategies
are evaluated and the ﬁttest strategies are then selected for the
next generation. Furthermore, new strategies are explored by
slightly modifying existing individuals using a mutation oper-
ator. The evolutionary process is repeated for a ﬁxed number
of generations.

It is important to note that, as explained earlier, we assume
that buyers are unaware that sellers shill bid (i.e., the sellers in
the game have private information). Thus, we are not simply
ﬁnding the Nash equilibrium of one large game, but we are ef-
fectively ﬁnding equilibria in two interrelated games; a buyer
game in which buyers select sellers based on the announced
reserve prices of the sellers, and a seller game, where sellers
seek to attract buyers by announcing attractive reserve prices
whilst simultaneously using shill bids to increase their rev-
enue. To achieve this within the evolutionary algorithm, we
simultaneously co-evolve the populations of buyer and seller
strategies, but determine the payoffs of the buyer and seller
strategies separately (i.e., the buyer payoffs are determined
as though sellers do not shill bid, whilst the seller payoffs are

determined by the ‘real’ game).

The results in this paper are based on the following EA set-
tings. Each population contains 30 strategies and the evolu-
tionary results are obtained after 500 generations. Each strat-
egy is evaluated by playing 1000 competing sellers games
with randomly generated buyer valuations. These valuations
are selected from a uniform distribution with support [0, 1].

5.2 Validation

In order to validate our evolutionary simulation we compare it
to the analytical results for two sellers from section 4.2. Fig-
ure 4 shows a comparison for all four cases whereby the two
bidders either announce a non-zero reserve price, or alterna-
tively, announce a zero reserve price and then submit a shill
bid. In these experiments, seller 1 and 2’s production costs are
set to 0.25 and 0.5 respectively. These settings were chosen
to illustrate representative outcomes when both sellers have
non-zero and asymmetric production costs. However, simi-
lar results are obtained for other combinations of production
costs (such results are not shown due to space limitations).
As can be seen, the results show an extremely good match.
In addition, we ﬁnd that, although analytical results are not
available for more than two auctions, even with more sellers
the simulation results converge and are consistent across runs
with different initial random seeds.

6 Auction Fees and Market Efﬁciency

In this section we consider how the mediating institution can
deter shill bidding by applying appropriate auction fees. To
this end, we apply the evolutionary simulation to compare
two types of auction fees. In addition, we investigate to what
extent the market is efﬁcient and how auction fees and shill
bidding affect this efﬁciency. Efﬁciency is a desirable prop-
erty since an efﬁcient market extracts the maximum surplus
that is available, and thus, it is important to take efﬁciency
into consideration when setting the auction fees.

6.1 Auction Fees

We consider two types of fees: (i) the closing-price (CP) fee
that is a fraction, β, of the selling price (where β is the CP
commission rate) and (ii) the reserve-difference (RD) fee that

most common in online auctions such as eBay, Yahoo!, and
Amazon, as well as in traditional auctions such as Sotheby’s
and Christie’s. The second type of fee is less common and
was ﬁrst introduced by Wang et al. [2004] where it was shown
to prevent shilling for particular bidder valuation distributions
in an isolated auction5. Similarly, our aim is to apply auction
fees in order to reduce the incentive of a seller to shill bid, but
we are considering a setting with competing sellers, and, in
addition, we are concerned with the efﬁciency of the market.
Another popular type of auction fee is the buyer’s pre-
mium, which is paid by the winner of the auction and is a
fraction of the closing price. Although this fee is typically
not applied to online auctions, it is still very common in tradi-
tional auctions. Surprisingly, however, we ﬁnd that this fee is
equivalent to the closing-price fee, provided that bidders are
rational (space limitations preclude a formal analysis here).
To see this, note that a bidder with a given valuation will cor-
rect his/her bid in the second-price auction such that the bid
plus the fee in case the bid is accepted is equal to the bidder’s
valuation. Interestingly, since all buyers thus lower their bids,
the seller ends up paying for the fee even though the fee is
originally charged to the buyers. The same holds in case of
other auctions such as the ﬁrst-price auction.

6.2 Market Efﬁciency
A market is efﬁcient when the items are awarded to the buyers
with the highest valuations. Here, we measure the relative
efﬁciency η of an allocation K, where η is given by:

η =

where K ∗ = arg maxk∈K[
i=1 xi(k)] is an
efﬁcient allocation, K is the set of all possible allocations, N
is the number of bidders, M is the number of sellers, vi(k)
is bidder i’s utility for an allocation k ∈ K, and xi(k) is

i=1 vi(k) −

seller i’s production costs for a given allocation (in order to
prevent a negative value we add production costs xi in both
the denominator and the numerator).

Now, a certain amount of inefﬁciency is inherent to the
competing sellers game as a result of the buyers randomis-
ing over sellers. For example, if two buyers with the highest
valuation both happen to choose seller 1, only one of them
is allocated the item and efﬁciency is not reached. However,
shill bidding further reduces this efﬁciency. Firstly, this oc-
curs because shill bidding enables a seller to hide its produc-
tion costs and therefore attract buyers that have no chance of
winning. A second source of inefﬁciency arises because a
declared reserve price is usually low due to competition. An
optimal shill bid, on the other hand, is higher than a declared
reserve price (and higher than production costs), resulting in
less sales, and therefore a lower efﬁciency.

6.3 Results

We now compare auction fees by considering: (1) the shill ef-
fect, which is measured as the difference that a buyer pays on
average with and without shill bids, (2) the relative efﬁciency
η as described in section 6.2, and (3) the seller costs, which
is the average that a seller pays to the mediator (i.e., the auc-
tioneer). The experimental results are shown in ﬁgure 5 for
different commission rates and number of sellers. In these
experiments, each seller’s production costs are randomly se-
lected from a uniform distribution with support [0, 0.5] at the
beginning of each run. In addition, the number of bidders is
set to an average of 3 per auction6.

As shown in ﬁgure 5(a), the RD fee is consistently better at
reducing the shill effect, irrespective of the number of sellers.
This is because the fee provides an incentive for lowering the
shill bid as well as increasing the reserve price (since this
reduces the difference between the closing price and reserve
price). The CP fee, on the other hand, is neutral with regards
to the reserve price.

By increasing the reserve price buyers can make a more
informed decision about which seller to choose. This is espe-

cially important if sellers have different production costs. On
the other hand, a higher reserve price may cause inefﬁciencies
if this results in less items being sold. Figure 5(b), however,
shows that both fees increase the market efﬁciency because of
the reduced shill bid, and that the RD fees are more effective
(if the RD fees are increased even further, however, the mar-
ket becomes less efﬁcient due to the high reserve prices, and
CP fees perform better). The latter occurs because, with RD
fees, the sellers’ reserve prices better reﬂect their production
costs. This is also conﬁrmed by other experiments showing
that the efﬁciency increase is similar for both fees if sellers
have no production costs (not shown due to space limitation).
We also consider the amount that sellers pay to the auc-
tioneer. These seller costs are important when mediators are
competing for sellers, and sellers may thus choose a different
mediator with lower fees. As shown in ﬁgure 5(c), the RD
fee results in much lower costs on average. Therefore, the
RD fees are much more effective given the same costs.

Finally, we consider whether buyers actually beneﬁt from
the reduced shill effect. The results, depicted in ﬁgure 6, show
a steady increase in buyer utility on average as the commis-
sion rates increase (this increase is not signiﬁcantly different
for RD and CP fees, however). Interestingly, these results
imply that buyer utility increases even in case of a buyer’s
premium, since this fee is essentially equivalent to the CP fee
(see section 6.1).

To conclude, the experiments show that the RD fee is more
effective in deterring shill bidding and increasing market ef-
ﬁciency. These results generalise beyond the two-seller case,
where the increased competition among sellers lowers the re-
serve prices and provides additional incentive to shill bid.
This is consistent with earlier results showing that RD auc-
tion fees can deter shill bidding for isolated auctions [Wang
et al., 2004]. However, our results show, for the ﬁrst time, that
these fees are also effective for a setting where sellers com-
pete. Moreover, we see that, when using the RD fee, sellers
pay much less to the mediator overall compared to CP fees.
The latter is especially important in a larger setting where
multiple mediating institutions compete to attract sellers.

7 Conclusions

Traditionally, competition among sellers has been ignored
when designing auctions and setting auction parameters.

However, in this paper, we have shown that auction param-
eters (such as a reserve price) play an important role in de-
termining the number and type of buyers that are attracted
to an auction when faced with competition. We have also
shown that such competition provides an incentive for sellers
to shill bid, but this can be avoided by a mediator that ap-
plies appropriate auction fees. These results become partic-
ularly relevant for online markets where competition is high
due to the ease with which a buyer can search for particu-
lar goods. Thus, in these settings, our results can be used by
sellers seeking to maximise their proﬁt, or by the auction in-
stitution itself, seeking to use appropriate auction fees to deter
shill bidding and thus increase the efﬁciency of the market.

Research on competing sellers is a relatively young ﬁeld
and there are still a large number of challenges remaining. In
future work, we intend to investigate the case where buyers
require multiple items and can participate in multiple concur-
rent auctions. Ultimately, we would like to extend the con-
cept of competition to the institutions themselves, and con-
sider a model in which the actual institutions attempt to attract
both sellers and buyers, whilst seeking to maximise revenue
through their auction fees.
