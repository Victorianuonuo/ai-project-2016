Abstract 

A  theory  and  system  are  described  for  the  se­

mantic  analysis  of  complex,  coherent  English  texts. 
The  principal  question  addressed  in  this  paper  is 
how  the  meanings  of  the  smaller  elements  of  Ian* 
guage  compose  into  the  meanings  of  larger  stretches 
of  text.  Within  sentence  boundaries,  this  is 
achieved  by  an  operation,  called  predicate  inter­
pretation,  which  provides  a  mechanism  for  general 
words,  especially  those  having  a  spatial  flavor,  to 
acquire  specific  interpretations  in  context.  Ee-
yond  sentence  boundaries  it  is  achieved  by  an  oper­
ation  which  matches  successive  sentences  against  a 
small  number  of  common  patterns  and  builds  up  a 
tree-like  structure  representing  the  text's  pat­
terns  of  coherence. 

In  isolation,  words  and  sentences  do  not  have 

In  this  paper  we  ask 
the  smaller  elements  of 

specific  meanings  so  much  as  they  have  the  poten­
t i al  for  acquiring  a  variety  of  specific  meanings 
in  particular  contexts. 
how 
the  meanings  of 
language  compose  into  the  meanings  of  larger 
stretches  of  text.  The  answers  proposed  come  out 
of  work  on  an  inferencing  system  being  developed 
for  the  Semantic  Analysis  of  complex,  coherent 
Texts  in  English  (called  SATE).  This  system  is  i n­
tended  to  be  general  and  is  being  applied  to  sets 
of  directions 
(Hobbs  1977),  and  complex  expository  texts 
(Hobbs  1976b).  Section  1  of  this  paper  b r i e f ly  de­
scribes  the  system  and  the  collection  of  world 
knowledge  axioms  it  rests  on.  Section  2  considers 
the  question  within  sentence  boundaries,  addressing 
the  problems  of  how  words  should  be  defined,  how 
context  influences  the  meanings  of  words,  and  how 
metaphors  are  to  be  interpreted.  Sections  3  and  4 
discuss  how  the  relations  between  sentences  can  be 
discovered  and  hence  how  the  structure  of  para­
graph-length  texts  can  be  b u i lt  up.

1.  The  Inferencing  System 

The  data  of  the  semantic  analyzer  is  of  two 

sorts  —  the  Text  and  the  Lexicon.  The  Text  may  be 
thought  of  as  episodic  memory  and  the  Lexicon  as 
permanent  memory.  The  Lexicon  contains  type  nodes, 
the  Text  token  nodes. 
I n i t i a l l y,  the  Text  contains 
the  information  explicit  in  the  paragraph  being 
analyzed,  expressed  in  a  simple  logical  notation 
produced  by  a  syntactic  preprocessor  (Grishman  et 
al  1973,  Hobbs  and  Grishman  1977).  The  logical 
notation  makes  explicit  the  functional  relation­
ships  between  elements  in  the  sentence  by  express­
ing  the  information  in  the  form  of  logical  proposi­
tions,  and  distinguishes  between  material  which  is 
asserted  and  material  which  is  grammatically  sub­
ordinated,  or  presupposed. 
In  the  course  of  seman­
t ic  processing,  certain  semantic  operations  augment 

the  Text  by  drawing  inferences, 
identifying  phrases 
in  different  parts  of  the  para­
graph  which  refer  to  the  same  entity,  and  structure 
it  by  discovering  relations  between  sentences. 

interrelate  it  by 

The  semantic  operations  work  by  searching  for 

chains  of  inference  in  the  Lexicon,  which  is  the 
store  of  lexical  and  world  knowledge.  The  Lexicon 
contains  the  "definitions"  of  English  words,  where 
a  definition  is  viewed  simply  as  the  set  of  infer­
ences  which  may  be  drawn  from  the  use  of  that  word. 
These  inferences  include  "superset"  relations,  such 
as  the  fact  that  a  bank  is  a  building, 

BANK: 

(Vy(bank(y) 

•*•  building (y)) 
and  that  to  walk  is  to  go  from  one  place 
another 

(z  ). 

(z.)  to 

WALK: 

(Vy)  (  3  z

)  <w a l kW  "*  g o t y ^ ^ )) 

1'z

2

These  axioms  are  part  of  the  definitions  of  "bank" 
and  "walk",  respectively.  The  definitions  also  i n­
clude  lexical  decompositions,  e.g.  that  for  y.  to 
go  from  y 
is  for  y 's  being  at  y2  to  become 
or  change  into  y^'s  being  at  y_: 

to  y 

GO: 

( V y1, y2, y3) ( g o ( y1, y2, y3)  •* 
become (at (y1 #y2)  ^atCy^y^)  ) 

(In  the  use  of  higher  predicates  like  "become",  we 
go  beyond  standard  predicate  calculus  notation.) 
Also  included  are  axioms  having  more  of  a  "world 
knowledge"  flavor,  such  as  the  fact  that  a  building 
has  a  roof: 

BUILDING: 

(Vy)  (3z) (building (y)  ■*  roof (z,y)) 

No  distinction  is  made  among  these  various  sorts  of 
axioms,  nor  between  "linguistic"  and  "non-linguis­
t i c"  knowledge. 

Inferences  are  not  drawn  freely,  but  only  in 

response  to  the  specific  demands  of  semantic  opera­
tions.  These  demands  take  two  forms, 
i . e.  they  i n­
voke  one  of  two  inferencing  procedures: 

Forward  inferencing:  From  p(A)  try  to  infer 

something  of  a  given  pattern. 

Backward  inferencing:  Find  something  in  the 
Text  from  which  p(A)  could  be  inferred. 
A  dynamic  ordering  determined  by  context  is 
imposed  on  the  axioms  in  the  Lexicon.  The  axioms 
are  divided  into  clusters,  perhaps  overlapping, 
roughly  according  to  topic.  The  clusters  are  given 
an  i n i t i al  measure  of  salience  according  to  their 
anticipated  relevance  to  the  text  at  hand.  The 
measures  of  salience  are  modified  in  the  course  of 
semantic  processing  in  response  to  changes  in  top­
i c.  When  a  fact  in  a  cluster  is  used,  the  entire 
cluster  is  given  maximum  salience;  while  the  facts 
in  a  cluster  are  not  being  used, 
i ts  salience  de­
cays.  The  Text  i t s e lf  is  treated  as  having  maxi­
mum  salience. 

The  search  for  a  chain  of  inference  is  then  an 
ordered  heuristic  search  whose  evaluation  function 
depends  upon  this  dynamic  ordering  and  upon  the 
length  of  the  chain  of  inference.  The  search  is 
discontinued  after  the  evaluation  function  reaches 
a  certain  thresh  old  •  For  example,  a  chain  of  i n­
ference  of  five  steps  might  be  found  if  the  axioms 
involved  are  of  high  salience,  whereas  with  axioms 
of  very  low  salience  the  search  would  be  cut  off 
after  just  one  step.

This  is  more  than  just  a  device  for  efficien­
cy.  There  may  be  more  than  one  chain  of  inference 
satisfying  the  requirements,  each  leading  to  a  d i f­
ferent  interpretation  of  the  text.  The  one  chosen 
is  the  f i r st  one  encountered  in  the  ordered  heuris­
t ic  search.  Thus,  not  only  the  inferencing  process 
but  also  the  interpretations  it  produces  are  made 
highly  dependent  on  global  context,  and  context  is 
not  merely  the  current  state  of  the  Text,  but  also 
the  current  state  of  the  dynamically  ordered  Lexi­
con. 

The  bulk  of  the  axioms  are  classed  as  only 
"Normally"  true,  which  means  an  inference  is  not 
drawn  if  it  would  result  in  a  contradiction.  For 
example,  we  can  normally  infer  from  "John  walks" 
that  "John  balances  on  his  feet",  but  if  we  have 
"John  walks  on  his  hands",  we  simply  refrain  from 
drawing  that  inference  [cf.  Cercone  and  Schubert 
19753.

Interpretation  and  Coherence  within 

Sentence  Boundaries 

The  basic  question  addressed  in  this  section 

is  how  to  interpret  words  in  context.  To  under­
stand  the  scope  of  this  problem,  consider  the  var­
iety  of  meanings  the  word  "go"  may  take  on,  even  in 
the  reasonably  well-behaved  sublanguage  of  algo­
rithm  descriptions. 
Go  to  step  T4. 

In 

"go"  means  that  the  processor  next  executes  the  i n­
struction  at  step  T4. 

In

it  means  that  the  value  of  N  successively  equals 
the  integers  from  1  to  100.

If  we  look  at 

The  problem  we  face  then  is  how  to  define 

words  l i ke  "go"  in  a  succinct  manner  in  such  a  way 
as  to  allow  this  profusion  of  possible  interpreta­
tions.  Heretofore,  the  typical  approach  has  been 
to  specify  a  large  number  of  the  word's  possible 
uses,  for  example,  by  means  of  a  l i st  of  environ­
ment  -  interpretation  pairs 
Schank  1976].  This  may  be  feasible  for  words  with 
a  small  number  of  quite  distinct  meanings,  such  as 
the  adjective  "fair"  which  can  mean  "mediocre", 
"light-complexioned",  or  "even-handed".  But  for 
the  most  common  words,

Our  approach  is  rather  to  define  a  word  in  as 
general  a  way  as  possible,  with  the  ideal  of  having 
one  sense  of  the  word  cover  a ll  i ts  uses.  The 
method  is  to  define  the  word  in  terms  of  very  gen­
eral  predicates.  When  the  word  is  encountered  in 
context,  a  semantic  operation,  called  predicate 
interpretation,  seeks  a  more  specific  interpreta­
tion  for  the  general  predicates. 

In  this  method,  "go"  can  be  defined  as  follows: 

g o ( yl/ y2> y3) l ( yl  g o eS

For  example, 

That  i s,  f i r st  from  the  explicit  properties  of  y. 
and  y2,  try  to  infer  Ma t ( y1, y2)"  —  try  to  dis­
cover  in  what  sense  y.  can  be  a£  y2,  where  "at"  is 
a  very  general  predicate  in  the  sense  that  it  can 
be  inferred  from  many  other  relations  between  two 
entities.  The  information  in  the  chain  of  infer­
ence  leading  to  "at(y.,y  )"  provides  the  more 
specific  relation  between  y.  and  y2.  Then  we  are 
free  to  infer  that  that  relationship  between  y.  and 
y2  changes  into  the  same  relationship  between  y, 
and  y3. 
is  being  analyzed,  predi­
cate  interpretation  must  determine  in  what  sense  N 
could  be  a£  1. 
It  does  so  by  accessing  an  axiom  in 
the  definition  of  "variable": 
(Vy,z)  (variable (y)  +  (equal(y,z)  -►  at ( y , z ) ) ). 
That  i s, 
w i ll  say  it  is  a£  that  point  on  the  number  scale. 
"At"  is  thus  a  generalization  of  "equal",  and  when 
we  say  that  a  variable  comes  to  be  at  a  number,  one 
of  the  things  it  could  mean  is  that  the  variable 
comes  to  equal  the  number. 
If  this  is  the  f i r st 
chain  of  inference  found  in  the  ordered  heuristic 
search,  then  this  is  the  interpretation  assumed. 

if  a  variable  is  equal  to  a  number,  we 

Our  approach  overcomes  the  objections  to  the 
multiple-sense  approach.  F i r st  of  a l l,  the  subtle 
shades  of  similarity  and  difference  among  various 
uses  of  a  word  are  captured  by  the  degree  to  which 
the  general  predicates  are  central  or  prevalent  in 
the  definition  of  the  word,  and  on  the  similarities 
among  the  chains  of  inference  interpreting  the  gen­
eral  predicates.  Secondly,  there  is  no  need  to 
anticipate  a ll  the  possible  uses  of  a  word,  for  i ts 
particular  interpretation  is  determined  by  means  of 
a  search  through  the  collection  of  world  knowledge 
axioms  which  is  needed  anyway  in  a  natural  language 
understanding  system.

example  of  one  of  the  basic  principles  upon  which 
the  deepest  levels  of  the  Lexicon  are  organized. 
Linguists  and  psychologists  have  frequently  noted 
that  in  English  and  other  languages,  one  often 
appeals 
spatial  metaphors  when  speaking  of 
abstract  ideas  [Whorf  1956,  Clark  1973,  Jackendoff 
1976].  These  permeate  language  to  such  an  extent 
that  they  generally  escape  notice.  For  example, 
in  the  previous  sentence  —  "permeate",  "extent",

prices",  "deep  thought",  "being  iii  p o l i t i c s ",  "a 
book  on  sociology",  "getting  the  idea",  "giving  an 
example". 

Mow  the  predicate  interpretation  method  allows 
us  to  turn  the  spatial  metaphor  into  a  powerful  aid 
in  the  analysis  of  English  texts. 

At  the  base  of  the  Lexicon  are  a  small  set  of 
cognitive  primitives  with  a  highly  spatial  or  v i s­
ual  flavor.  Among  these  are  the  notion  of  a  scale, 
which  results  from  conceptualizing  a  "becoming" 
from  one  state  to  another,  and  may  be  thought  of 
roughly  as  a  p a r t i al  ordering;  several  notions 
which  give  structure  to  scales, 
being  0n  a  scale  or  a  member  of  the  p a r t i a l ly 
ordered  set,  one  point  exceeding  another  on  the 
scale,  and  three  operators,  Lr,  Md,  and  Sm,  which 
isolate  imprecise  overlapping  regions  near  the  top, 
middle,  and  bottom  of  a  scale,  respectively;  and 
the  notion  of  an  entity  being  a  a  point  on  a 
scale,  or  an  entity  being  at  another  entity.  At, 
scale,  and  the  Lr,  Md,  and  Sm  operators  are  gener­
al  predicates  capable  of  a  wide  variety  of  possible 
interpretations  in  a  given  context. 

including  a  point 

The  most  common  words  are  then  defined  in 

terms  of  these  primitives.  For  example,  verbs  of 
motion, 
like  "go",  have  an  underlying  at  which  can 
get  interpreted  as  physical  location  or  some  meta­
phorical  location,  as  we  have  seen.  Many  preposi­
tions  also  have  an  underlying  "at";  "under"  can  be 
defined  in  terms  of  the  relative  positions  at_which 
i ts  arguments  are  located  on  a  real  or  metaphorical 
vertical  scale  —  metaphorical  to  handle  such  sen­
tences  as 

The  GNP  is  under  what  it  was  last  year. 

A  word  like  "greater"  is  defined  in  terms  of  exceed 
and  scale.  Depending  on  the  arguments  of  "greater", 
scale  can  get  interpreted  in  various  ways.  A  word 
like  " t a l l"  gets  defined  usually  in  terms  of  the 
specific  physical  height  scale  but  also  in  terms  of 
the  "Lr"  operator;  the  interpretation  of  "Lr"  de­
pends  on  context  —  whether  it  is  a  " t a ll  building" 
or  a  " t a ll  glass  of  beer". 

Many  interpretations  are  achieved  by  defining 

other  relations  as  instances  of  "at",  as  in  (2). 
Moreover,  "at"  can  be  related  to  predication  in 
general.  We  take  our  cue  from  equivalences  such  as 

John  is  hard  at  work  -  John  is  working  hard, 
and  similar  "argument  +  preposition  +  predication" 
combinations,  such  as 

John  is  in  control  of  the  situation  *  John

Jackendoff  [1976]  has  classified  word  senses 
of  verbs  of  motion  into  positional,  possessional, 
identificational,  and  circumstantial  modes.  Our 
approach  now  provides  an  explanation.  Consider

In  our  ap­
proach,  "turn"  and  "into"  are  defined  in  terms  of, 
among  other  things,  the  predicate  "at".  One  as­
pect  of  the  meaning  of  "X  turned  into  Y"  may  be  r e­
presented

The  nature  of  Y  is  explored  to  determine  in  what 
sense  X  could  be  at  Y.

fact  that  a  driveway  is  intended  to  be  a  path  leads 
to  the  spatial  interpretation  of  "at".

The  approach  to  defining  and  interpreting 

words  which  has  been  presented  here  is  very  compel­
ling  on  several  counts. 
It  allows  us  to  collapse 
a  seemingly  large  number  of  senses  of  a  word  into 
a  very  few. 
It  is  appealling  as  a  psychological 
model  since  it  rests  on  the  close  connection  be­
tween  visual  imagery  and  language. 
It  is  a  method 
which  treats  v i r t u a l ly  everything  as  a  metaphor  to 
be  interpreted  in  context,  and  thus  provides  a

framework  in  which  spatial  metaphors,  as  well  as 
much  other  metaphor,  can  be  treated  not  as  an  anom­
aly  but  as  the  natural  state  of  a f f a i r s. 

3.  Coherence  Beyond  Sentence  Boundaries 

Where  there  is  an  explicit  intersentence  con­

nective,  such  as  "but",  "because",  " i . e . ",  the 
problem  of  determining  or  verifying  the  relation 
between  the  sentences  becomes  just  a  special  case 
of  predicate  interpretation.  The  connective  is 
viewed  as  a  higher  predicate  whose  arguments  are 
the  assertions  of  the  sentences  it  connects.  The 
requirements  associated  with  the  connective  are 
just  those  conditions  which  make  the  sentences 
stand  in  contrastive,  causal  or  paraphrastic  rela­
tion  to  each  other.  However,  since  most  intersen­
tence  relations  are  implicit,  a  separate  semantic 
operation  is  required  to  recognize  them. 

We  attempt  to  determine  intersentence  rela­

tions  by  seeking  to  match  the  current  sentence  and 
the  previous  text  against  a  small  number  of  the 
most  common  patterns  of  coherence  that  link  senten­
ces.  The  patterns  are  stated  in  terms  of  inferen­
ces  that  can  be  drawn  from  the  current  sentence 
and  a  previous  sentence,  and  the  modification  to 
be  performed  on  the  Text  if  the  pattern  is  matched. 
Among  the  patterns  we  have  studied  are  Temporal 
Succession,  Cause,  Contrast,  Violated  Expectation, 
Paraphrase,  Example,  and  P a r a l l e l. 
l i st  is  exhaustive,  but  it  has 
claimed  that  this 
been  adequate  for  the  quite  diverse  texts  which 
have  been  examined  so  f a r. 

It  is  not 

The  intersentence  operation  keeps  these  pat­
terns  on  a  goal  l i st  while  processing  a  sentence. 
Strengths  are  associated  with  each  pattern, 
ting  the  urgency  with  which  we  want  it  matched. 
The  strength  depends  on  the  type  of  text  being  an­
alyzed,  the  presence  of  conjunctions  and  certain 
adverbs,  and  the  expectations  created  in  the  analy­
sis  of  the  previous  text.  The  heuristic  search 
which  seeks  chains  of  inference  to  satisfy  the  pat­
terns  is  ordered  by  the  strength  of  the  goal  as 
well  as  the  length  of  the  chain  of  inference  and 
the  salience  of  the  axioms  in  i t. 

indica­

To  see  how  the  patterns  are  to  be  stated  and 

how  the  pattern-matching  proceeds,  consider  the 
following  example: 

Republicans  were  encouraged  about  their 

prospects.  The  party  chairman  believed 
that  Dewey  would  be  elected. 

I n t u i t i v e l y,  this  is  an  instance  of  the  Example 
pattern.  To  recognize  it  computationally  requires 
us  to  access  our  knowledge  of  "Republican",  "en­
courage",  and  so  forth. 

More  precisely, 

l et  the  Example  pattern  be 

stated  as  follows: 

The  predicate  and  arguments  of  the  assertion 

of  the  current  sentence  stand  in  a  sub­
set  or  element-of  relation  to  those  of 
the  previous  sentence. 

Suppose  "be  encouraged"  decomposes  into  "be­
lieve  something  good  w i ll  happen".  Sentences  are 
processed  from  the  top-down,  so  that  in  the  second 
sentence  "the  party  chairman  believes"  is  process­
ed  f i r s t.  Since  the  party  chairman  is  a  member  of 

the  set  of  Republicans  and  since  the  "believes" 
matches  the  "believe"  of  "be  encouraged",  the 
f i r st  part  of  the  Example  pattern  is  matched.  Be­
cause  of  this  p a r t i al  match,  the  strongest  goal 
for  the  processing  of  the  "that"  clause  is  to  show 
what  is  believed  is  that  something  good  for  a  Re­
publican  w i ll  happen.  This  is  done  by  accessing 
the  fact  about  a  p o l i t i c al  party  that  one  of  i ts 
purposes  is  to  win  elections,  and  the  fact  about 
Dewey  that  he  is  a  Republican. 

The  target  representation  for  the  analysis  of 
a  paragraph  is  a  tree-like  structure  indicating  the 
relations  between  sentences  in  the  paragraph.

as  follows:

There  are  two  varieties  of  this  pattern.

exhibits  two  varieties  of  the  pattern  interlocking. 
The  f i r st  sentence  asserts  a  change  in  location; 
the  f i n al  position  is  implicit  in  the  second  sen­
tence  and  is  the  beginning  of  the  change  of  posi­
tion  described  in  the  t h i r d.  Moreover,  the  f i r st 
sentence  implies  one  orientation,  the  third  sen­
tence  implies  another  and  the  second  asserts  a 
change  from  the  former  to  the  l a t t e r. 

The  patterns  are  exhibited  twice  in  the  f o l­

lowing  text: 

He  observed  a  badly  joined  connection  in 

the  mechanism.  He  took  it  to  his  work­
shop  to  f i x. 

The  f i r st  sentence  describes  a  change  in  knowledge, 
a  coming  to  know  that  something  is  broken.  The 
second  sentence,  via  "workshop"  and  " f i x ",  implies 
that  knowledge. 

2.  Cause:  There  are  two  varieties  of  this 

pattern: 

a.  Find  a  causal  chain  from  S.  to  S2. 
b.  Find  a  causal  chain  from  S2  to  S.. 

The  second  variety  is  exemplified  twice  in  the  text. 

He  was  in  a  foul  humor.  He  had  slept  badly 

during  the  night.  His  electric  blanket 
had  worked  only  intermittantly. 

The  causality  between  the  third  and  second  senten­
ces  can  be  established  by  noting  that  the  purpose 
of  a  blanket  is  to  enable  sleep,  so  that  a  blanket 
f a i l i ng  in  i ts  purpose  (not  working)  causes  one  not 
to  sleep.  The  causal  chain  between  the  second  and 
the  f i r st  is  that  sleep  enables  one  to  overcome 
fatigue  and  fatigue  frequently  brings  on  a  foul

humor. 

The  role  of  this  relation  in  narratives  has 

been  studied  by  Schank  (1974)  and  Rumelhart  (1975). 

3.  Contrast:  Letting  "element"  refer  to 

either  the  predicate  or  one  of  the  arguments  of  a 
statement,  the  Contrast  pattern  may  be  stated  as 
follows: 

From  S  and  S 

infer  S'  and  S ',  respectively, 

where 
1)  S'  and  S'  have  one  corresponding  pair 

2) 

of  elements  which  are  contradictory 
or  l ie  at  opposite  ends  of  some  scale; 
the  other  corresponding  pairs  of  ele­
ments  are  identical  or  belong  to  the 
same  small  set  ( i . e.  are  "similar"). 

Consider  the  text 

You  are  not  likely  to  h it  the  bull's  eye, 

but  you're  more  l i k e ly  to  h it  the  bull's 
eye  than  any  other  equal  area. 

SI  is  the  f i r st  clause,  S2  the  second.  From  s1, 
we  can  infer,  by  axioms  associated  with  "likely", 
that  the  probability  of  hitting  the  b u l l 's  eye 
(call  it  p.) 
. 5,  or  whatever  other 
value  counts  as  "likely".  From  S  ,  we  can  infer 
that  p. 
hitting  those  other  equal  areas 
we  have 

is  greater  than  the  typical  probability  of 
Thus 

is  less  than 

(call  it  p . ). 

S I ':  p  <  .5 
S2': 
Pl  >  p2 

The  predicates  of  S I'  and  S2'  —  "<"  and  ">"  ~ 
are  contradictory.  The  f i r st  arguments  are  identi­
cal  —  "p  ".  The  second  arguments  —  ".5"  and 
"p  "  —  are  similar  in  that  both  are  probabilities. 
Hence,  the  Contrast  pattern  is  matched. 

In  the  text 
Research  proper  brings 

into  play  clockwork-
like  mechanisms;  discovery  has  a  magical 
essence. 

"research"  and  "discovery"  are  viewed  as  similar 
elements  and  "mechanistic"  and  "magical"  as  lying 
at  opposite  ends  of  some  scale. 

4.  Violated  Expectation:  This  pattern  holds 

if  from  S.  one  can  normally  infer  S,  but  from s2 
one  can  infer  not  S.  Not  S  is  what  we  are  expect­
ed  to  believe. 

In 
This  paper  is  weak,  but  interesting 

the  f i r st  clause  SI  would  lead  us  to  infer  that 
the  paper  is  not  suitable  for  presentation,  but 
the  second  S2  contradicts  t h i s. 
It  is  the  infer­
ence  from  the  second  clause  we  are  to  believe. 

5.  Paraphrase: 

It  is  frequent  for  stretches 

of  text  to  be  attempts  at  the  successive  approxi­
mation  of  a  meaning,  or  attempts  to  overcome  the 
possibility  of  misunderstanding.  The  pattern  may 
be  stated 

infer  S1 
From  the  assertions  of  S1  and  S2, 
and  S2,  respectively,  where  S1  and  S' 
are  the  same  except  that  either 

1)  an  argument  of  S' 

is  more  f u l ly  or  pre­
cisely  described  than  the  corresponding 
argument  of  S',  or 

lacks. 

2)  S'  has  adverbial  modification  S' 
Consider  the  text 
This  immense  tract  of  time  is  only  sparsely 
illuminated  by  human  r e l i c s.  Not  enough 
material  has  yet  been  found  for  us  to 
trace  the  technical  evolution  of  East  Asia. 

(call  this  statement 

From  our  knowledge  of  "sparse"  and  "illuminate", 
we  can  infer  from  the  f i r st  sentence  S1  that  the 
relics  f a il  to  cause  one  to  know  the  "contents"  of 
the  immense  tract  of  time 
S I ' ).  From  "not  enough"  in  the  second  sentence  S2, 
we  can  infer  that  the  material  f a i ls  to  cause  us  to 
know  the  "contents"  of  the  technical  evolution 
(call  this  S 2 ' ).  S1'  and  S2  both  have  the  form 
fail(cause(A,know(we,B))),  contents-of(E,C) 
S I'  describes  A  as  "relics"  while  S2'  uses  "mater­
i a l ",  near  synonyms.  C,  which  in  S I' 
is  described 
as  an  "immense  tract  of  time", 
is  specified  more 
precisely  in  S2'  as  "technical  evolution  of  East 
Asia".  Hence,  the  Paraphrase  pattern  is  recog­
nized. 

6.  Parallel:  The  pattern  for  this  relation 

is 

From  the  assertions  of  S1  and  S  ,  infer  S1 

and  S',  respectively,  where  the  correspond­
ing  pairs  of  elements  are  identical  or  mem­
bers  of  some  small  set. 

At  least  one  pair  must  be  non-identical.  This  pet-
tern  is  frequently  keyed  by  similar  syntactic 
structures. 

In 
Set  stack  A  to  empty,  and  set  link  variable 

P  to  ROOT. 

the  predicates  and  agents  of  both  sentences  are 
the  same,  A  and  P  are  both  data  structures  and  A 
being  empty  and  P  pointing  to  ROOT  are  both  ex­
amples  of  plausible  i n i t i al  values. 

4.  An  Example 

In  this  section  we  examine  one  paragraph  very 

it  assumes  state-of-the-art  syn­

b r i e f ly  to  see  the  discourse  structure  that  is 
produced.  A  detailed  analysis  has  been  carried 
out  by  hand  and  is  available  in  Hobbs 
(1976b). 
Implementation  of  the  analysis  is  in  progress. 
Unsurprisingly, 
tactic  preprocessing.  Semantic  analysis  requires 
a  Lexicon  of  at  least  several  hundred  axioms  en­
coding  knowledge  ranging  from  properties  of  basic 
spatial,  temporal,  and  mental  concepts  to  very 
specific  facts  about  American  p o l i t i c s.  The 
chains  of  inference  needed  to  establish  some  of 
the  intersentence  relations  are  quite  long  in  some 
cases  and  it  is  not  yet  clear  what  can  be  expected 
from  a  computer  implementation. 

The  paragraph  comes  from  Newsweek.  The 

clauses  and  sentences  are  labelled  for  subsequent 
reference.
