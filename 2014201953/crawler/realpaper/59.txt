Abstract

We study fair division of indivisible goods among
agents from the point of view of compact repre-
sentation and computational complexity. We iden-
tify the complexity of several problems, including
that of deciding whether there exists an efﬁcient
and envy-free allocation when preferences are rep-
resented in a succinct way. We also draw connec-
tions to nonmonotonic reasoning.

1 Introduction
Allocation of goods among agents has been considered from
different perspectives in social choice theory and AI. In this
paper we focus on fair division of indivisible goods without
money transfers. Fair division makes a prominent use of fair-
ness criteria such as equity and envy-freeness, and on this
point totally depart from auctions, where only efﬁciency is
relevant (and moreover a speciﬁc form of efﬁciency, since
the criterion to be maximized is the total revenue of the auc-
tioneer). Envy-freeness is a key concept in the literature on
fair division: an allocation is envy-free if and only if each
agent likes her share at least as much as the share of any
other agent. Ensuring envy-freeness is considered as cru-
cial; however, envy-freeness alone does not sufﬁce as a cri-
terion for ﬁnding satisfactory allocations,
therefore it has to
be paired with some efﬁciency criterion, such as Pareto opti-
mality. However, it is known that for any reasonable notion of
efﬁciency, there are proﬁles for which no efﬁcient and envy-
free allocation exists (see [Brams et al., 2000])1.

Whereas social choice theory has developed an important
literature on fair division, computational issues have rarely
been considered. On the other hand, artiﬁcial intelligence
has studied these issues extensively, but until now has fo-
cused mainly on combinatorial auctions and related prob-
lems,
investigating issues such as compact representation
as well as complexity and algorithms. Complexity issues
for negotiation (where agents exchange goods by means of
[Dunne et al., 2005;
deals) have also been studied (e.g.
Chevaleyre et al., 2004]). See also [Bouveret et al., 2005]
for a preliminary complexity study of fair division problems.

1This is even trivial if every good must be assigned to someone:
in this case, there are proﬁles for which not even an envy-free allo-
cation exists.

The above discussion reveals the existence of a gap: com-
pact representation and complexity issues for fair division
have received very little attention until now, apart of the re-
cent work [Lipton et al., 2004] which studies approximation
schemes for envy-freeness. The need for compact representa-
tion arises from the following dilemna, formulated by several
social choice theorists:
either (a) allow agents to express
any possible preference relation on the set of all subsets of
items, and end up with an exponentially large representation
(such as in [Herreiner and Puppe, 2002]); or (b) severely re-
strict the set of expressible preferences, typically by assuming
additive independence between items, and then design proce-
dures where agents express preferences between single items,
thus giving up the possibility of expressing preferential de-
pendencies such as complementarity and substitutability ef-
fects among items; this is the path followed by [Brams et al.,
2000] and [Demko and Hill, 1998]. Yet, as we advocate in
this paper, conciliating conciseness and expressivity is possi-
ble, by means of compact representation.

As in most works on fair allocation of indivisible items
we focus on the joint search for envy-freeness and efﬁciency.
The impossibility to guarantee the existence of an efﬁcient
envy-free allocation implies that determining whether there
exists such an allocation is a crucial task, since a positive an-
swer leads to choose such an allocation whereas a negative
answer calls for a relaxation of one of the criteria. We con-
sider this problem from the point of view of compact repre-
sentation and computational complexity. We focus ﬁrst in
the simple case where agents have dichotomous preferences,
that is, they simply express a partition between satisfactory
and unsatisfactory shares. The interest of such a restriction
is that in spite of the expressivity loss it imposes, it will be
shown to be no less complex than the general case, while be-
ing much simpler to expose. The most natural representa-
tion of a dichotomous preference is by a single propositional
formula, where variables correspond to goods. Expressing
envy-freeness and efﬁciency within this logical representation
reveals unexpected connections to nonmonotonic reasoning.
We identify the complexity of the key problem of the exis-
tence of an envy-free and Pareto-efﬁcient allocation, which
turns out to be Σp
2-complete; we also identify the complexity
of several other problems obtained either by imposing some
restrictions on the latter or by replacing Pareto-efﬁciency by
other criteria. In Section 5 we extend this result to the case of
non-dichotomous, compactly represented preferences.

2 Background
2.1 Fair division problems
Deﬁnition 1
A fair division problem is a tuple P = hI, X, Ri where

• I = {1, . . . , N } is a set of agents;
• X = {x1, . . . , xp} is a set of indivisible goods;
• R = hR1, . . . , RN i is a preference proﬁle, where each
Ri is a reﬂexive, transitive and complete relation on 2X.
Ri is the preference relation of agent i. ARiB is alterna-
tively denoted by Ri(A, B) or by A (cid:23)i B; we note A ≻i B
(strict preference) for A (cid:23)i B and not B (cid:23)i A and A ∼i B
(indifference) for A (cid:23)i B and B (cid:23)i A.

In addition, Ri is said to be monotonous if and only if for
all A, B, A ⊆ B ⊆ X implies B (cid:23)i A. R = hR1, . . . , RN i
is monotonous if and only if Ri is monotonous for every i.
Deﬁnition 2

• An allocation for P = hI, X, Ri is a mapping π : I →
2X such that for all i and j 6= i, π(i) ∩ π(j) = ∅. If for
every x ∈ X there exists a i such that x ∈ π(i) then π is
a complete allocation.

• Let π, π′ two allocations. π dominates π′ if and only if
(a) for all i, π(i) (cid:23)i π′(i) and (b) there exists an i such
that π(i) ≻i π′(i). π is (Pareto-) efﬁcient if and only if
there is no π′ such that π′ dominates π.

• An allocation π is envy-free if and only if π(i) (cid:23)i π(j)

holds for all i and all j 6= i.

2.2 Propositional logic
Let V be a ﬁnite set of propositional variables. LV is the
propositional language generated from V , the usual connec-
tives ¬, ∧ and ∨ and the Boolean constants ⊤ and ⊥ in the
usual way2. An interpretation M for LV is an element of
2V , i.e., a truth assignment to symbols: for all x ∈ V , x ∈ M
(resp. x 6∈ M ) means that M assigns x to true (resp. to false).
M od(ϕ) = {M ∈ 2V | M |= ϕ} is the set of all models of
ϕ (the satisfaction relation |= is deﬁned as usual, as well as
satisﬁability and logical consequence).

A literal is a formula of LV of the form x or of the form ¬x,
where x ∈ V . A formula ϕ is under negative normal form (or
NNF) if and only if any negation symbol in ϕ appears only in
literals. Any formula can be turned in polynomial time into
an equivalent NNF formula. For instance, a ∧ ¬(b ∧ c) is not
under NNF but is equivalent to the NNF formula a∧(¬b∨¬c).
A formula is positive if it contains no occurrence of the
negation symbol. For instance, a ∧ (b ∨ ¬c) and a ∨ (¬a ∧ b)
are not positive, whereas a ∧ (b ∨ c) and (a ∧ c) ∨ (a ∧ b) are.
⊤ and ⊥ are considered positive as well.

Let ϕ ∈ LV . V ar(ϕ) ⊆ V is the set of propositional
variables appearing in ϕ. For instance, V ar((a ∧ c) ∨ (a ∧
b)) = {a, b, c} and V ar(⊤) = ∅.

Lastly, if S = {ϕ1, . . . , ϕn} is a ﬁnite set of formulas then
V S = ϕ1 ∧ . . . ∧ ϕn is the conjunction of all formulas of S.
2Note that connectives → and ↔ are not allowed; this is impor-

tant for the deﬁnition of positive formulas (to come).

2.3 Computational complexity
In this paper we will refer to some complexity classes located
in the polynomial hierarchy. We assume the reader to be fa-
miliar with the classes NP and coNP. BH2(also referred to
as DP) is the class of all languages of the form L1 ∩ L2
2= PNP is the class of
where L1 is in NP and L2 in coNP. ∆p
all languages recognizable by a deterministic Turing machine
working in polynomial time using NP oracles. Likewise, Σp
2=
NPNP. Θp

lems that only need a logarithmic number of oracles. See for
instance [Papadimitriou, 1994] for further details.

3 Fair division problems with dichotomous

preferences: logical representation

We start by considering in full detail the case where prefer-
ences are dichotomous.
Deﬁnition 3 Ri is dichotomous if and only if there exists a
subset Goodi of 2X such that for all A, B ⊆ X, A (cid:23)i B if
and only if A ∈ Goodi or B 6∈ Goodi. R = hR1, . . . , RN i
is dichotomous if and only if every Ri is dichotomous.

There is an obvious way of representing dichotomous pref-
erences compactly, namely by a propositional formula ϕi (for
each agent i) of the language LX (a propositional symbols for
each good) such that M od(ϕ) = Goodi. Formally:
Deﬁnition 4 Let Ri be a dichotomous preference on 2X, with
Goodi its associated subset of 2X, and ϕi a propositional
formula on the propositional language LX. We say that ϕi
represents Ri if and only if M od(ϕi) = Goodi.

Clearly, for any dichotomous preference Ri there is a for-
mula ϕi representing Ri; furthermore, this formula is unique
up to logical equivalence.
Example 1 X = {a, b, c} and Goodi = {{a, b}, {b, c}}.
Note that Ri is not monotonous. Then ϕi = (a ∧ b ∧ ¬c) ∨
(¬a ∧ b ∧ c) represents Ri.

An easy but yet useful result (whose proof is omitted):

Proposition 1 Let Ri be a dichotomous preference on 2X.
The following statements are equivalent:

1. Ri is monotonous;
2. Goodi is upward closed, that is, A ∈ Goodi and B ⊇ A

imply B ∈ Goodi.

3. Ri is representable by a positive propositional formula.
From now on, we assume that allocation problems P are
represented in propositional form, namely, instead of I, X
and R we only specify hϕ1, . . . , ϕN i. I and X are obviously
determined from hϕ1, . . . , ϕN i.

Let P = hϕ1, . . . , ϕN i be an allocation problem with di-
chotomous preferences; then for each i ≤ N , we rewrite ϕi
into ϕ∗
i obtained from ϕi by replacing every variable x∗ by
the new symbol xi. For instance, if ϕ1 = a ∧ (b ∨ c) and
ϕ2 = a ∧ d then ϕ∗

1 = a1 ∧ (b1 ∨ c1) and ϕ∗

2 = a2 ∧ d2.

For all i ≤ N , let Xi = {xi, x ∈ X} An allocation for
a standard allocation problem P corresponds to a model of
V = X1 ∪. . .∪XN satisfying at most one xi for each x ∈ X.
In other terms, there is a bijective mapping between the set of

possible allocations and the models of the following formula

ΓP = Vx∈X Vi6=j ¬(xi ∧ xj)

If allocation are required to be complete, then ΓP is replaced
P = ΓP ∧Vx∈X(x1 ∨ . . . ∨ xn). The rest in unchanged.
by ΓC
Let V = {xi | i = 1, . . . , N, x ∈ X}. Any interpretation
M of M od(ΓP ) is such that it is never the case that xi and xj
are simultaneously true for i 6= j, therefore we can map M ∈
M od(ΓP ) to an allocation F (π) = M simply deﬁned by
π(i) = {x | M |= xi}. This mapping is obviously bijective,
and we denote F −1(M ) the allocation corresponding to an
interpretation M of M od(ΓP ).

3.1 Envy-freeness
We now show how the search for an envy-free allocation can
j|i be the formula
be mapped to a satisﬁability problem. Let ϕ∗
i by
obtained from ϕ∗
xj: for instance, if ϕ∗
2|1 = a2 ∧
(b2 ∨ c2). (Obviously, ϕ∗
Proposition 2 Let P = hϕ1, . . . , ϕN i be an allocation prob-
lem with dichotomous preferences under propositional form,
and the formulas ϕ∗
j|i and mapping F as deﬁned above. Let

1 = a1 ∧ (b1 ∨ c1) then ϕ∗

i .)
i|i = ϕ∗

i ∨ (cid:16)Vj6=i ¬ϕ∗
Then π is envy-free if and only if F (π) |= ΛP.

ΛP = Vi=1,...,N hϕ∗

j|i(cid:17)i

The proof is simple, so we omit it. The search for envy-free
allocations can thus be reduced to a satisﬁability problem:
{F −1(M ) | M |= ΓP ∧ΛP } is the set of envy-free allocations
for P Note that, importantly, ΓP ∧ ΛP has a polynomial size
(precisely, quadratic) in the size of the input data.
Example 2
ϕ1 = a ∨ (b ∧ c); ϕ2 = a; ϕ3 = a ∨ b.
ΛP = ((a1 ∨ (b1 ∧ c1)) ∨ (¬(a2 ∨ (b2 ∧ c2)) ∧ ¬(a3 ∨ (b3 ∧ c3)))
∧ (a2 ∨ (¬a1 ∧ ¬a3)) ∧ ((a3 ∨ b3) ∨ (¬(a1 ∨ b1) ∧ ¬(a2 ∨ b2));
M od(ΓP ∧ ΛP ) = {{c1}, {c1, b3}, {c2, b3}, {c2}, {b3}, {c3}, ∅}.
There are therefore 7 envy-free allocations, namely (c, −, −),
(c, −, b),
(−, −, c) and
(−, −, −). Note that none of them is complete.

3.2 Efﬁcient allocations
Deﬁnition 5 Let ∆ = {α1, . . . , αm} a set of formulae and β
a formula. S ⊆ ∆ is a maximal β-consistent subset of ∆ iff
(a) V S ∧ β is consistent and (b) there is no S′ such that S ⊂
S′ ⊆ ∆ and V S′ ∧ β is consistent. Let M axCons(∆, β) be
the set of all maximal β-consistent subsets of ∆.
Proposition 3 Let P = hϕ1, . . . , ϕN i an allocation prob-
lem. Let ΦP = {ϕ∗
N }. Then π is efﬁcient for P if
and only if {ϕ∗
i } is a maximal ΓP -consistent
subset of ΦP .

1, . . . , ϕ∗
i | F (π) |= ϕ∗

This simple result, whose proof is omitted, suggests that ef-
ﬁcient allocations can be computed from the logical expres-
sion Φ of the problem, namely, by computing the maximal
ΓP -consistent subsets of Φ; call them {S1, . . . , Sq}. Then for
each Si, let Mi = M od(V Si ∧ ΓP ) and let M = ∪q
i=1Mi.
Then F −1(M ) is the set of all efﬁcient allocations for Φ3.

3Note that there are in general exponentially many maximal ΓP -
consistent subsets of Φ (and therefore exponentially many efﬁcient

1, ϕ∗

2}, S2 = {ϕ∗

Example 2 (cont’d) The maximal ΓP -consistent subsets of
Φ are S1 = {ϕ∗
2, ϕ∗
3}.
V S1 ∧ ΓP has only one model: {b1, c1, a2}. V S2 ∧ ΓP has
two models: {a1, b3} and {b1, c1, a3}. V S3 ∧ ΓP has one
model: {a2, b3}. Therefore the four efﬁcient allocations for
P are (bc, a, −), (a, −, b), (bc, −, a) and (−, a, b). None of
them is envy-free.

3} and S3 = {ϕ∗

1, ϕ∗

3.3 Efficient and envy-free allocations
We are now in position of putting things together. Since
envy-free allocations corresponds to the models of ΛP and
efﬁcient allocations to the models of maximal ΓP -consistent
subsets of ΦP , the existence of an efﬁcient and envy-free
(EEF) allocation is equivalent to the following condition:
there exists a maximal ΓP -consistent subset S of ΦP such
that V S ∧ ΓP ∧ ΛP is consistent. In this case, the models
of the latter formula are the EEF allocations. Interestingly,
this is an instance of a well-known problem in nonmonotonic
reasoning:
Deﬁnition 6 A supernormal default theory4 is a pair D =
hβ, ∆i with ∆ = {α1, . . . , αm}, where α1, . . . , αm and β
are propositional formulas. A propositional formula ψ is a
skeptical consequence of D, denoted by D |∼∀ ψ, if and only
if for all S ∈ M axCons(∆, β) we have V S ∧ β |= ψ.
Proposition 4 Let P = hϕ1, . . . , ϕN i a fair division prob-
lem. Let DP = hΓP , ΦP i. Then there exists an efﬁcient and
envy-free allocation for P if and only if D 6|∼∀ ¬ΛP .

This somewhat unexpected connection to nonmonotonic
reasoning has several
implications. First, EEF allocations
correspond to the models of V S ∧ ΓP ∧ ΛP for S ∈
M axCons(ΦP , ΓP ); however, M axCons(ΦP , ΓP ) may be
exponentially large, which argues for avoiding to start com-
puting efﬁcient allocations and then ﬁltering out those that
are not envy-free, but rather compute EEF allocations in a
single step, using default reasoning algorithms thus, fair di-
vision may beneﬁt from computational work in default logic
and connex domains such as belief revision and answer set
programming. Moreover, alternative criteria for selecting ex-
tensions in default reasoning (such as cardinality, weights or
priorities) correspond to alternative efﬁciency criteria in allo-
cation problems.

4 Allocation problems with dichotomous

preferences: complexity

2-complete [Gottlob,
It is known that skeptical inference is Πp
1992]; now, after Proposition 4, the problem of the existence
of an EEF allocation can be reduced to the complement of a
skeptical inference problem, which immediately tells that it

allocations). This can be tempered by (a) there are many practical
cases where the number of maximal consistent subsets is small; (b)
it is generally not asked to look for all efﬁcient allocations; if we
look for just one, then this can be done by computing one maximal
ΓP -consistent subset of Φ.

prerequisites” (e.g., [Reiter, 1980]).

is in Σp
2. Less obviously, we now show that it is complete for
this class, even if preferences are required to be monotonous.
Let us ﬁrst note that skeptical inference remains Πp
2-
complete under these two restrictions (to which we refer as
RSI, for RESTRICTED SKEPTICAL INFERENCE): (a) ψ = ϕ1;
(b) n ≥ 2. (Here is the justiﬁcation: ∆ |∼ ψ if and only
if ∆ ∪ {ψ, ψ} |∼ ψ.) Equivalently, RSI is the problem of
deciding whether, given ∆ = hα1, . . . , αni with n ≥ 2, all
maximal consistent subsets of ∆ contain α1.
Proposition 5 The problem EEF EXISTENCE of determining
whether there exists an efﬁcient and envy-free allocation for a
given problem P with monotonous, dichotomous preferences
under logical form is Σp

2-complete.

We show hardness by the following reduction from RSI
(the complement problem of RSI) to EEF EXISTENCE. Given
any ﬁnite set ∆ of propositional formulae, let V∆ = V ar(∆)
the set of propositional symbols appearing in ∆, and let
P = H(∆) the following instance of EEF EXISTENCE:
(1) I = {1, 2, ..., n + 2};
(2) X = {vi|v ∈ V∆, i ∈ 1...n} ∪ {¯vi|v ∈ V∆, i ∈ 1...n}

∪ {xi|i ∈ 1...n} ∪ {y};

(3) for each i = 1, . . . , n, let βi be obtained from αi by the
following sequence of operations: (i) put αi into NNF form
i be the result); (b) for every v ∈ V∆, replace, in α′
(let α′
i,
each (positive) occurrence of v by vi and each occurrence of
¬v by ¯vi; let βi be the formula obtained. Then
• ϕ1 = β1 ∨ x1;
• for i = 2, . . . , n, ϕi = βi ∧ xi;
• ϕn+1 = (cid:16)(cid:16)Vv∈V ar(∆) (cid:0)Vn
• ϕn+2 = y.

i=1 ¯vi(cid:1)(cid:17) ∧ x1(cid:17)∨y;

i=1 vi(cid:1) ∨ (cid:0)Vn

Lemma 1 An allocation π for P is said to be regular if and
only if for all i 6= n, π(i) ⊆ σ(i), where

• for all i 6= n, σ(i) = Sv∈V∆{vi, ¯vi}S{xi};
• σ(n + 1) = Sv∈V∆,i=1,...,n{vi, ¯vi}S{x1, y};
• σ(n + 2) = {y}.

Let now πR deﬁned by πR(i) = π(i) ∩ σi. Then

1. πR is regular;
2. π is efﬁcient if and only if πR is is efﬁcient;
3. if π is envy-free then πR is is envy-free.

Proof: (1) is obvious. For all i, the goods outside σ(i) do
not have any inﬂuence on the satisfaction of i (since they
do not appear in αi), therefore πR(i) ∼i π(i), from which
(2) follows. The formulas αi being positive, the preference
relations (cid:23)i are monotonous, therefore π(j) (cid:23)i πR(j) holds
for all i, j. Now, if π is envy-free then for all i, j we have
π(i) (cid:23)i π(j), therefore πR(i) ∼i π(i) (cid:23)i π(j) (cid:23)i πR(j)
and πR is envy-free, from which (3) follows.

(cid:4)

Lemma 2 If π is regular then

1. 1 can only envy n + 1;

2. 2, . . . , n envy noone;
3. n + 1 can only envy n + 2;
4. n + 2 can only envy n + 1;

Proof: First, note that for any i, j 6= i, i envies j if and only
if π(i) |= ¬ϕi and π(j) |= ϕi.
1. Let i = 1 and j ∈ {2, . . . , n, n + 2}. Assume 1 envies
j. Then π(j) |= ϕ1. π being regular, x1 6∈ π(j), therefore
π(j) |= β1. Now, since π is regular, π(j) does not contain
any vi nor any ¯vi; now, β1 can only be made true by
variables vi or ¯vi (which cannot be the case here) unless it is
a tautology. Now, if β1 is a tautology, then 1 is satisﬁed by π
and cannot envy j, a contradiction.
2. Let i ∈ {2, . . . , n} and j 6= i.
If i envies j then
π(j) |= βi ∧ xi, which is impossible because xi 6∈ π(j), due
to the regularity of π.
3. Let i = n + 1. Assume n + 1 envies 1 then π(1) |= ϕn+1.
Since π(1) |= y is impossible (because π is regular), we have
π(1) |= Vv∈V∆ (cid:0)Vn
i=1 vi(cid:1) ∨ (cid:0)Vn
i=1 ¯vi(cid:1) ∧ x1, which implies
i=1 vi(cid:1) or π(1) |= (cid:0)Vn
that either π(1) |= Vv∈V∆ (cid:0)Vn
i=1 ¯vi(cid:1).
Both are impossible because π is regular and n ≥ 2. The
case j ∈ {2, . . . , n} is similar.
4. Let i = n + 2 and j 6= n. If i envies j then π(j) |= y,
which is impossible because π is regular.

(cid:4)

Lemma 3 Let π be a regular allocation satisfying n + 1 and
n + 2. Let M (π) be the interpretation on V∆ obtained from
π by: for all v ∈ V∆, M (π) |= v (i.e., v ∈ M (π)) if n + 1
receives ¯v1, . . . , ¯vn, and M (π) |= ¬v otherwise, i.e., if n + 1
receives v1, . . . , vn. Then π is envy-free iff M (π) |= α1.
Proof: Let π be a regular allocation satisfying n + 1 and
n + 2. Since π satisﬁes n + 2, y ∈ π(n + 2). Now, π
satisﬁes n + 1 without giving him y, therefore, for any v,
n + 1 receives either all the vi’s or all the ¯vi’s. This shows
that our deﬁnition of M (π) is well-founded. Now, since π
is regular, it is envy-free if and only if (a) 1 does not envy
n+1, (b) n+1 does not envy n+2 and (c) n+2 does not envy
n+1. Since n + 1 and n + 2 are satisﬁed by π, we get that π
is envy-free if and only if 1 does not envy n+1, that is, if and
only if either π(1) |= ϕ1 or π(n + 1) 6|= ϕ1. Now, π(n + 1)
contains x1, therefore π(n + 1) |= ϕ1, which entails that π
is envy-free if and only if π(1) |= ϕ1. This is equivalent to
π(1) |= β1, because 1 does not get x1 (which is assigned to
n+1), which in turn is equivalent to M (π) by construction. (cid:4)

Lemma 4 For each interpretation M over V∆, let us deﬁne
πM : I → 2X by:

• πM (1) = {v1 | M |= v} ∪ {¯v1 | M |= ¬v};
• for each i ∈ 2, . . . , n, πM (i) = {vi | M |= v} ∪

{¯vi | M |= ¬v} ∪ {xi};

• πM (n + 1) = {x1} ∪ {¯vi | M |= v, i = 1, . . . , n} ∪

{vi | M |= ¬v, i = 1, . . . , n};

• πM (n + 2) = {y}

Then:

1. πM is a well-deﬁned and regular allocation satisfying

n + 1 and n + 2;

2. MπM = M (MπM is obtained from πM as in Lemma3).
3. for any i ∈ 1, . . . , n, πM satisﬁes i iff M |= αi.

4. πM is efﬁcient iff M satisﬁes a maximal consistent sub-

set of ∆.

Proof:
1. πM does not give the same good to more than one individ-
ual, therefore it is an allocation. The rest is straightforward.
2. if M |= v then πM (n + 1) contains {¯vi | i = 1, . . . , n}
and therefore M (πM ) |= v. The case M |= ¬v is similar.
3. let i ∈ 2, . . . , n. Since πM gives xi to i, πM satisﬁes i if
and only if πM (i) |= βi, which is equivalent to M |= αi. If
i = 1 then, since πM does not give x1 to 1, πM satisﬁes 1 if
and only if πM (1) |= β1, which is equivalent to M |= α1.
4. from point 3, {i, πM satisﬁesi} = {i, M |= αi}. Now,
since preferences are dichotomous, an allocation π is
efﬁcient if and only if the set of individuals it satisﬁes is
maximal with respect to inclusion. Therefore, πM is efﬁcient
if and only if M satisﬁes a maximal consistent subset of ∆. (cid:4)

Lemma 5 Let π be a regular and efﬁcient allocation satisfy-
ing n+1 and n+2. Then M (π) satisﬁes a maximal consistent
subset of ∆.
Proof: π is regular and satisﬁes n + 1 and n + 2, therefore
π(n + 2) = {y}, x1 ∈ π(n + 1), and M (π) is well-deﬁned.
Let π′ obtained from π by

• π′(1) = {v1|M (π) |= v} ∪ {¯v1|M (π) |= ¬v};
• for each i = 2, . . . , n: π′(i) = {vi|M (π) |= v} ∪

{¯vi|M (π) |= ¬v} ∪ {xi};

• π′(n+1) = {x1}∪{vi|M (π) |= ¬v}∪{¯vi|M (π) |= v};
• π′(n + 2) = {y}.

π being regular and satisfying n + 1 and n + 2, we have
π(n + 1) = π′(n + 1), π(n + 2) = π′(n + 2), and then for
each i, π(i) ⊆ π′(i): indeed, let j ∈ {2, . . . , n} (for n + 1
and n + 2 this inclusion is obviously satisﬁed); then (a) π
is regular, therefore π(j) ⊆ σ(j); now, all goods of σ(j)
are either in π′(j) or in π(n + 1) (namely: x1 if j = 1 and
all the vj such that M (π) |= ¬v and all the ¯vj such that
M (π) |= v); therefore, π(j) ⊆ π′(j) ∪ π(n + 1), which,
together with π(1) ∩ π(n + 1) = ∅, implies π(j) ⊆ π′(j).
Since preferences are monotonous, all individuals satisﬁed
by π are satisﬁed by π′ as well; and since π is efﬁcient, π and
π′ satisfy the same set of individuals. Now, we remark that
π′ = πM(π). By Lemma 4, π′ is efﬁcient iff M (π) satisﬁes a
maximal consistent subset of ∆, from which we conclude. (cid:4)

Lemma 6 Any envy-free and efﬁcient allocation for P sati-
ﬁes n + 1 and n + 2.
Proof: Suppose π doesn’t satisfy n + 1; then y 6∈ π(n + 1);
now, if y ∈ π(n + 2) then n + 1 envies n + 2; if y 6∈ π(n + 2)
then π is not efﬁcient because giving y to n + 2 would satisfy
n + 2 and thus lead to a better allocation than π.
Now, suppose π does not satisfy n + 1, i.e., y 6∈ π(n + 2);
if y ∈ π(n + 1) then n + 2 envies n + 1; if y 6∈ π(n + 1)
then again, π is not efﬁcient because giving y to n + 2 would
satisfy n + 2 and thus lead to a better allocation than π.

(cid:4)

Proof: Let π be an efﬁcient and envy-free allocation. By
Lemma 1, πR is regular, efﬁcient and envy-free. By Lemma
6, πR satisﬁes n + 1 and n + 2. Then by Lemma 5, M (πR)
satisﬁes a maximal consistent subset of ∆, and by Lemma
3, M (πR) |= α1. Therefore Sat(M (πR), ∆) is a maximal
consistent subset of ∆ and contains α1.

(cid:4)

Lemma 8 If there exists a maximal consistent subset of ∆
containing α1 then there exists an EEF allocation.
Proof: Assume that there exists a maximal consistent subset
S of ∆ containing α1, and let M be a model of S. By point
4 of Lemma 4, πM is efﬁcient.
By point 1 of Lemma 4, πM is regular; then by Lemma 2,
πM is envy-free if and only if (i) 1 does not envy n + 1, (ii)
n + 1 does not envy n + 2 and (iii) n + 2 does not envy
n + 1. By point 1 of Lemma 4, πM satisﬁes n + 1 and n + 2,
therefore (ii) and (iii) hold. Lastly, by point 5 of Lemma 4,
M |= α1 implies that πM satisﬁes 1, therefore (i) holds as
well and πM is envy-free.

(cid:4)

from Lemmas 7 and 8, the ex-
Proof of Proposition 5:
istence of a maximal consistent subset of ∆ containing α1
and the existence of an efﬁcient and envy-free allocation
for P = H(∆) are equivalent. Clearly, H is computed in
polynomial time. Therefore, H is a polynomial reduction
from RSI to EEF EXISTENCE, which shows that the latter
problem is Σp

2-hard, and therefore Σp

2-complete.

(cid:4)

As a corollary, this Σp

2-completeness result holds for gen-
eral (not necessarily monotonous) dichotomous preferences.
As a consequence of this high complexity, it is worth study-
ing restrictions and variants of the latter problem for which
complexity may fall down. We start by considering identical
dichotomous preference proﬁles, that is, all agents have the
same preference, i.e. the same formula ϕ.
Proposition 6 EEF EXISTENCE with N identical dichoto-
mous, monotonous preferences is NP-complete, for any ﬁxed
N ≥ 2.

Due to space limitations the proofs of this result and the
following ones are omitted5. Note that we have here a hard-
ness result for any ﬁxed number of agents (≥ 2). Things are
different with Proposition 5, for which hardness does not hold
when N is ﬁxed. Namely, the following holds for N = 2:
Proposition 7 EEF
monotonous dichotomous preferences is NP-complete.

two agents with

EXISTENCE

for

Unlike Proposition 5, these results are sensitive to whether

preferences are required to be monotonous or not.
Proposition 8 EEF EXISTENCE with N identical dichoto-
mous preferences is coBH2-complete, for any ﬁxed N ≥ 2.
Proposition 9 EEF EXISTENCE for 2 agents with dichoto-
mous preferences is coBH2-complete.
Complexity decreases as well if we weaken Pareto-efﬁciency
by only requiring allocations to be complete:

Lemma 7 If there exists an EEF allocation, then there exists
a maximal consistent subset of ∆ containing α1.

Proposition 10 The existence of a complete envy-free allo-
cation for agents with monotonous, dichotomous preferences
is NP-complete, even for 2 agents with identical preferences.
Lastly, replacing Pareto-efﬁciency by an utilitarianistic notion
of efﬁciency results in a complexity decrease as well:
Proposition 11 The existence of an envy-free allocation sat-
isfying a maximal number of agents with monotonous di-
chotomous preferences is Θp

2-complete.

5 Non-dichotomous preferences
We now consider the case where preferences are no longer
dichotomous. Again, since an explicit description of prefer-
ences is exponentially large, the need for a compact descrip-
tion thereof is clear. Many languages exist for succinct rep-
resentation of preference. However, Proposition 5 extends to
any language, provided that (a) it extends propositional logic,
i.e., it is able to express compactly any dichotomous pref-
erence represented by a propositional formula; (b) comparing
two sets of goods can be done in polynomial time. Conditions
(a) and (b) are met by many languages for succinct represen-
tation of preference6. Under assumptions (a) and (b):
Corollary 1 EEF EXISTENCE with monotonous preference
under logical form is Σp

2-complete.

For the latter result preferences do not have to be numerical
since Pareto efﬁciency and envy-freeness are purely ordinal
notions. Now, if preferences are numerical, which implies the
possibility of intercomparing and aggregating preferences of
several agents, then, besides Pareto-efﬁciency, we may con-
sider efﬁciency based on social welfare functions. We con-
sider here only the two most classical way of aggregating a
collection of utility functions hu1, . . . , uni into a social wel-
fare function sw: utilitarianism (sw = Pi ui) and egalitari-
anism (sw = mini ui).
Proposition 12 Given a collection of utility functions on 2R
given in compact form:

• the problem of the existence of an envy-free allocation
2-complete,

maximizing utilitarian social welfare is ∆p
even if N = 2.

• the problem of the existence of an envy-free allocation
2-complete,

maximizing egalitarian social welfare is ∆p
even if N = 2.

A last case that has not been considered is the case of addi-
tive numerical preferences. In the latter case, the utility func-
tion of agent i ≤ N is simply expressed by the p numbers
ui({xj}), j = 1, . . . , p. While the existence of a complete
envy-free allocation is easily shown to be NP-complete (see
[Lipton et al., 2004]), things become much harder with EEF
EXISTENCE: all we know is that this problem is NP-hard and
in Σp

2, but its precise complexity remains an open problem.
6For the sake of illustration, we pick here one of the most sim-
ple ones, similar to those used for combinatorial auctions: agents’
preferences are numerical (i.e., utility functions) and are represented
by a set of propositional formulas, each of which is associated with
a weight denoting its importance; the utility of a set of goods is
the sum of the weights of the formulas satisﬁed. Preferences are
monotonous if all formulas are positive and all weights are positive.
See for instance [Lang, 2004] for a survey of logical languages for
compact preference representation.

6 Concluding remarks
We have identiﬁed the exact complexity of the key problem
of deciding whether there exists an efﬁcient and envy-free
allocation when preferences are represented compactly, in
several contexts; we have also considered variations of the
problem. We have also drawed connections to a well-studied
problem in nonmonotonic reasoning. The next step will
consist in designing and experimenting algorithms for the
search of an EEF allocation (when it exists) and approxima-
tion notions for deﬁning optimal allocations when there is
no EEF allocation (see [Lipton et al., 2004] for approximate
envy-freeness, although not coupled with efﬁciency).
