Abstract.  A  model  of  auditory  temporal  recall 
based  on  correlographic  recording  and  Inter(cid:173)
rogation  by  convolution  is  presented.  Complex 
tree  and  loop  structured  memory  sequences  can 
be  recorded,  with  selective  recall  based  on 
fragmentary  cues.  The  sequences  are  "re(cid:173)
membered"  by  proceeding  through  a  recorded  net 
of  associations  u n t il  the  coherence  of  the 
retrieved  signals  f a l ls  to  a  sufficiently  low 
level.  This  indicates  no  further  significant 
recall  is  possible  without  an  additional  exter(cid:173)
nal  cue. 

A  computer  simulation  of  this  model  using 
digitised  speech  has  produced  variable-length 
and  cyclic  sound-segment  recall  from  fragmen(cid:173)
tary  cues. 

Introduction.  The  problem  of  recording  infor(cid:173)
mation  in  a  manner  so  as  to  associate  it  with 
other  recently  received  information  and/or  old 
information  recalled  by  the  present  environment, 
appears  to  be  at  least  a  prerequisite  to  I n t e l(cid:173)
ligent  behavior. 

*  We  are  concerned  here  with  presenting  a 

model  of  paired-associate  recording  and  recall 
that  may  have  the  necessary  potential. 

The  possibility  of  recall  based  upon  holo(cid:173)
graphic  techniques  was  presented  by  Stroke  (1) 
as  a  compensation  or  f i l t er  effect,  and  later 
by  Collier  and  Pennington  (2)  as  recall  based 
upon  fragments  (possibly  displaced)  of  the  orig(cid:173)
inal  scene.  This  verified  Van  Heerden's  (3) 
earlier  prediction  made  on  a  theoretical  basis. 
The  experimental  setup  for  displaying  this 

phenomena  is  shown  In  Figures  1  and  2. 

An  interesting  possibility  of  using  this 

as  a  model  of  an  associative  memory  comes  from 
the  fact  that  multiple  exposures  can  be  made  on 
the  same  hologram  and,  after  development,  illum(cid:173)
ination  by  a  fragment  from  one  of  the  scenes 
w i ll  recall  that  original  scene  provided  suit(cid:173)
able  circumstances  are  insured. 

In  the  following  discussion  we  shall  be 

primarily  concerned  with  auditory  signals  rather 

than  visual,  but  thay  are  generally  Just  a  re(cid:173)
striction  to  one  dimension  rather  than  two. 

The  possibility  of  recording  the  auditory 

analog  to  Figures  1  and  2  was  suggested  by 
Longuet-Hlggins  (4)  and  extended  to  a  neural 
model  by  Chopping  (5). 
In  the  auditory  model  a 
given  time  signal  is  considered  to  be  made  up  of 
two  successive  fragments,  a(t)  and  b ( t ).  Then 
the  magnitude  of  the  power  spectral  density  is 
recorded  as 

|Ffa(t)}  +  F { b ( t ) }|  Â«  (A  +  B)(A  +  B) 

where 

A  =  F{a(t)} 

is  the  Fourier  transform  of  a(t)  and  (  ) 
complex  conjugate. 

is  the

terms  in  Equation 
the  convolution  of  the  signal  b(t)  with  the 
autocorrelation  of  the  signal  a ( t ).  Assuming 
the  autocorrelation  peak  at  t  -  0  is  much  great(cid:173)
er  than  at  any  of  the  other  registrations, 
then 
the  convolution  of  this  with  b(t)  w i ll  reproduce 
b ( t ).  Further  assume  that  for  a  term  such  as 
AAB  ,  there  are  no  peaks  in  the  cross  correla-
that  are  comparable  to 
tion  represented  by  AB

the 
convolution  with  a(t)  would  act  to  severely 
attenuate  a ( t ). 

In  this  case, 

For  the  above  assumptions  then,  the  four

AAA  +  AAB  +  ABA  +  ABB  =  a(t) + n + b(t) + a ( t) 

where  n  represents  noise  as  an  attenuated  and 
multiply-echoed  a ( t ). 

The  reconstruction  sequence  above  does 

contain  the  recall  of  b(t)  and  by  a  property  of

Thus,  by  recording  the  power  spectrum  of 

the  original  sequence  and  illuminating  that 
recording  with  the  spectrum  of  a  fragment  and 
inverse  transforming  the  transmitted  spectrum, 
and  f i n a l l y,  playing  the  resulting  sequence,  one 
hears  the  recall  fragment  followed  by  the remain(cid:173)

It  is  similarly  possible  to  use  the  cueb(t)

tra  correspond  to  circular  correlations  or  con(cid:173)

the  recalled 
segment  a(t)  would  follow  after  the  cue  b ( t ). 
Multiple  exposures  can  be  made  and  each 

in  the  replay, 

exposure  can  be  composed  of  more  than  two  frag(cid:173)
ments.  However, 
there  is  some  d i f f i c u l ty  in 
overcoming  the  noise  that  is  added  from  these 
additional  terms.  For  example,  suppose  we  have 
made  two  exposures,  the  f i r st  using  the  frag(cid:173)
ments  a,  and  a2  and  the  second  using  a3  and  a..

Then  upon  attempted  recall  using  a.  we  obtain 

where  the  n's  represent  the  noise  contributions, 
and,  of  course,  the  a4'a  and  a3  have  the  imper(cid:173)

A  study  of  the  signal-to-noise  ratios  that 
can  be  expected  based  upon  various  numbers  of 
exposures  and  fragment  length  to  total  signal 
length  has  been  reported  by  Wlllshaw  and  Longuet-
Higgins  (6). 

Proposals  have  been  made  by  Gabor  (7)  and 

Willshaw,  Buneman  and  Longuet-Higgins  (8)  to 
eliminate  a  significant  amount  of  noise  by  re(cid:173)
cording  only  the  necessary  correlographic  terms 
rather  than  the  power  spectral  density.  This 
enhancement  is  included  in  the  sections  below. 
The  very  peaked  nature  of  the  autocorrela(cid:173)

signals,  especially  speech  signals.  And,  a l(cid:173)

this  w i ll  insure  that 

The  next  sections  also  include  a  method  for 

sharpening  this  autocorrelation  peak  without 
having  to  r e s t r i ct  the  nature  of  the  primary  i n(cid:173)

A  form  of  sequential  recall  was  proposed  by 

Longuet-Higgins  (9),  but  it  is  not  possible  in 

Session No.  4 Associative and Adaptive  Models

holographic  recording  without  receding  the  infor(cid:173)
mation  between  successive  cues. 

The  model  to  be  discussed  w i ll  allow  the 
sequences  to  be  tied  back  upon  themselves  to 
give  continuing  circular  recall. 
In  the  simu(cid:173)
l a t i o n,  an  estimate  is  made  of  the  signal-to-
noise  r a t i o,  and  as  this  falls  to  a  small  value, 
the  recall  is  terminated  pending  the  next  exter(cid:173)
nal  cue. 

Sound  Segments.  Experimental  f a c i l i t i es  have 
been  established  for  obtaining  digitized  speech. 
This  is  accomplished  by  low-pass  f i l t e r i ng  the 
speech  input  to  less  than  half  the  sampling  fre(cid:173)
quency  (to  prevent  aliasing).  This  filtered  i n(cid:173)
put  is  then  sampled  periodically  and  converted 
via  an  analog-to-digital  converter  and  stored  in 
digitized  form. 

To  minimize  the  amount  of  d i g i t al  storage 
required,  various  sampling  rates  and  numbers  of 
quantization  levels  have  been  considered.  After 
some  experimentation,  a  sampling  frequency  of 
4000Hz.  and  three  bits  of  quantization  were adopti(cid:173)
ed  as  nearly  the  minimum  quality  suitable. 

After  the  speech  signals  were  in  d i g i t al 

form  they  were  disected  into  elements  for  a  cata(cid:173)
log  of  sound  segments.  These  segments  included 
spoken  d i g i t s,  phonemes  and  some  complete  words. 
These  sound  segments  can  be  referenced  by  a  dic(cid:173)
tionary  process  and  concatenated  for  subsequent 
processing  or  digital-to-analog  conversion. 

Using  this  standard  set  of  auditory  signals 
obviates  some  of  the  severe  problems  dealing with 
the  v a r i a b i l i ty  of  actual  speech  such  as  changes

to  transform  the  digitized  speech  segments  x(k) 
to  the  frequency  domain  X(J).  Each  segment  is 
padded  to  be  4096  samples  long  (one  second  of 
speech)  and  the  fast  Fourier  transform  is  used. 
Associates  come  in  pairs,  but  they  each  re(cid:173)

of  the  f i r st  transform  and  the  second  transform, 
and  this  product  is  added  to  any  previously  ac(cid:173)

This  sequence  of  paired-associations  can  be 
continued  down  a  chain  of  successive  speech  seg(cid:173)
ments  and/or  new  paired-associate  sequences  can 
be  added.  For  example,  the  correlogram 

[4] 

records  the  associations  a-b,  b-c,  and  d-e. 

The  individual  paired-associates  are  equi(cid:173)
valent  to  the  discrete  Fourier  transform  of  the 
circular  cross-correlation  between  the  sound  seg(cid:173)

i.e. 

where  k  is  the  index  of  the  transform  summation, 
DFT  is  the  discrete  Fourier  transform,  and  the 
Index  (1+k)  is  evaluated  modulo  N.

correlation  produces  a  relatively  uniform  spec(cid:173)

sound  the  characteristic  that  it  has  been  passed 
through  a  drain-pipe  acoustic  f i l t e r. 

The  desired  autocorrelation  properties  can 

be  produced  by  the  following  techniques. 

In  order  to  avoid  the  successive  reinforcing 

registrations  of  the  periodic  components  during 
autocorrelation, 
their  periodicities  must  be  re(cid:173)
moved  during  the  recording  process.  This  can  be 
done  by  permuting  the  d i g i t al  samples  within  a 
sound  segment,  and  if  the  permutation  gives  the 
signal  a  sufficiently  noise-like  character, 
the 
autocorrelation  w i ll  produce  the  single  peak  at 
t-0,  and  the  associated  spectrum  w i ll  be  rela(cid:173)
tively  uniform.  The  reverse  of  this  permutation 
can  be  carried  out  on  the  recalled  element  to 
restore  i ts  periodic  properties. 

This  permutation  coding  seems  rather  simi(cid:173)
lar  to  the  f i r st  layer  transformation  in  a  multi(cid:173)
layer  perceptrem  as  discussed  by  Minsky  and 
Pappert  (10),  and  the  cortical  layered  calcula(cid:173)
tions  proposed  by  Kabrisky  (12). 

The  following  permutation  is  easy  to  visual(cid:173)

ize  and  implement  and  does  not  require  a  permu(cid:173)
tation  table.  Given  an  original  sample  of  N  -  2 
points,  and  suppose  we  are  going  to  take  points 
from  this  sample  but  that  our  selector  runs  at 
linearly  increasing  tempo.  Then  the  i ' th  o r i g i(cid:173)
nal  sample  goes  into  the  b ' th  c e ll  as 

the  alphabet,  weekday  names,  etc.,  readily  in  the 
forward  direction  but  poorly  in  reverse. 

This  recall  is  accomplished  from  a  cue  by 

taking  its  transform,  passing  the  transform 
through  the  correlogram  (multiplication),  and 
inverse  transforming  the  result.  For  instance, 
assume  the  previous  recording  given  in  Equation 
[4],  then  using  b  as  a  cue  gives 

subject  to  the  previous  assumptions  about  the 
auto  and  cross-correlations.  Here  then,  the 
desired  recalled  element  c  may  be  obtained  in 
a  relatively  unencumbered  manner  as  opposed  to 
the  recall  of  a3  given  in  Equation  [2]. 

The  recalled  element  in  [5]  was  obtained  as 
the  convolution  of  the  segment  c  with  the  auto(cid:173)
correlation  of  b,

It  should  be  noted  that  the  correlations 
and  convolutions  could  be  carried  out  in  the 
time  domain,  but  it  is  about  an  order  of  magni(cid:173)

plane  in  d i g i t al  simulation  when  N  =  4096.

In  the  convolution  then,  each  of  these  peaks  con(cid:173)

each  copy  delayed  by  the  interval  between  the

is  thus  highly  reverberative  and  is  not  easily

While  the  above,  or  a  random  permutation, 
does  give  the  desired  autocorrelation  result, 
it  is  at  the  expense  of  a  rather  desirable  fea(cid:173)

Sequential  Recall.  The  possibility  of  recalling 
a  l i st  of  items  occurs  when  one  considers  using 
a  recall  production  as  a  cue  for  a  further  inter(cid:173)
rogation.  This  is  a  possibility  in  correlo-
graphic  recording  whereas  it  is  not  with  the 
hologram  or  holophone  because  they  reproduce  the 
cue  as  part  of  the  recall  which  could  not  then 
be  directly  recycled  for  further  r e c a l l.  Time 
division  selection  also  would  not  be  satisfactory 
in  a  discrete  system  because  of  the  periodicity 
requirement. 

Now  consider  the  recording

With  an  arbitrary  permutation  encoding,

is  not  sufficient  to  be  quite  close  to  the  regis(cid:173)

In  a  par(cid:173)
ticular  sample,  over  the  range  of  spoken  d i g i t s, 
phonemes,  and  several  short  words,  the  ratio  of 
autocorrelation  peaks  to  maximum  cross-correla(cid:173)
tion  peaks  varies  from  three  or  four-to-one  to 
50-to-one.  Of  course,  this  depends  greatly  upon 
the  samples,  and  the  time  and  amplitude  quanti(cid:173)
sation.  The  important  point  to  be  made  here  is 
that  the  permutation  coding  discussed  above  was 
done  solely  to  enhance  the  autocorrelation  prop(cid:173)

are  hardly  affected. 
It  may  be  true  that  both

For  cyclic  sequences  the  same  termination 

mechanism  is  employed.  This  works  because 
there  are  more  and  more  convolutions  of  auto(cid:173)
correlations  convolved  with  the  desired  sequence 
in  one  particular  term  of  the  recall  sum  and  the 
number  of  noise  terms  is  increasing.  So,  as 
contrasted  to  non-cyclic  recall  dropping  off  the 
end  of  the  initiated  sequence,  cyclic  recall 
fades  into  the  noise  and  is  ultimately  aborted.

Then  the  original  signal  is  judged  to  be

As  might  be  expected,  this  detection  is

vidual  sequences  by  furnishing  the  appropriate 
cues. 

The  variable-length  sequences  are  "re-mem(cid:173)
bered"  by  cycling  a  production  as  the  next  cue 
until  the  output  contains  no  further  signals. 
As  can  be  seen  from Table  1,  the  present 

simulation  is  rather  limited  in  terms  of  the 
total  amount  of  information  that  can  be  recorded 
before  the  noise  produced  masks  the  desired  re(cid:173)
call  elements.  A  practical  improvement  in  this 
aspect  can  probably  be  obtained  by  filtering  the 
output  to  consist  only  of  the  same  exceptional 
spectral  components  that  are  used  to  identify  the 
fact  that  there  is  actually  a  signal  present. 

Further  improvement  may  be  made  by  making 

the  permutation  (or  other)  encoding  dependent 
upon  some  well-preserved--preserved  through  re(cid:173)
cording  and  recall--property  of  each  individual 
signal. 

Of  great  interest  is  how  the  memory  mech(cid:173)

anism  can  be  made  more  dynamic.  That  is,  succes(cid:173)
sive  recordings  should  be  made  as  associations 
with  recent  external  inputs  and  the  internal  re(cid:173)
call  they  may  have  triggered.  Also,  recall  i t(cid:173)
self  should  be  done  so  as  to  modify  the  infor(cid:173)
mation  retained.
