Abstract

In  this  paper,  a  study  on  the  suitability  of  an  ap-
pearance  based  model,  specifically  PCA  based 
model,  for  the  purpose  of  recognising  fingerspel-
ling (sign language) alphabets is made. Its recogni-
tion  performance  on  a  large  and  varied  real  time 
dataset  is  analysed.  In  order  to  enhance  the  per-
formance of a PCA based model, we suggest to in-
corporate  a  sort  of  pre-processing  operation  both 
during training and recognition. An exhaustive ex-
periment  conducted  on  a  large  number  of  finger-
spelling  alphabet  images  taken  from  20  different 
individuals  in  real  environment  has  revealed  that 
the  suggested  pre-processing  has  a  drastic  impact 
in  improving  the  performance  of  a  conventional 
PCA based model.

1  Introduction 
Automatic  sign  language  recognition  has  enormous  social 
significance.  It  would  lead  to  integration  of  people  with 
voice  and  hearing  disability  to  communicate  and  interact 
with the society. Sign language recognition is being actively 
pursued  by  the  research  community  around  the  world.  A 
survey  of  techniques  adopted  for  recognition  [LaViola, 
1999; Pavlovic et al, 1997] give a review of techniques used 
in the broader area of hand gesture recognition. Pioneering 
work in this area was by [Starner and Pentland, 1995] using 
Hidden Markov Models (HMM) which recognises 40 signs 
from American Sign Language by extracting a feature vec-
tor  describing  the  hand  shape,  orientation  and  trajectory. 
Hand modeling was avoided by tracking the coloured hand 
gloves worn by the user and in addition the usage of HMM 
gave the time context. [Gao et al., 2000] use cyber gloves 
and  positional  trackers  to  get  features  for  recognising  the 
user signs employing HMM, Artificial Neural Network and 
Dynamic Programming techniques. To overcome the expen-
sive cost of cyber gloves, [Hern√°ndez et al., 2002] use inex-

pensive micro accelerometers to extract postures of hand as 
3-D  patterns.  Classification  into  sub  classes  was  done  by 
projecting the vectors on to different planes, and hierarchi-
cal  decision  tree  was  used  to  classify  within  subclasses. 
They report an excellent success rate for majority of signs of 
fingerspelling alphabets. [Fang et al., 2004] report the use of 
cyber gloves to capture features and classify large vocabu-
lary of signs using Fuzzy Decision trees. Recently [Chale-
chale  et  al.,  2005]  reported  the  use  of  geometric  and  mo-
ment  based  properties  of  fingerspelling  hand  postures  to 
classify  them  using  Bayesian  rule  assuming  Gaussian 
distribution  of  the  properties.  They  report  a  very  good 
success rate, but it needs to be mentioned that they use ges-
tures  of  single  user  with  black  background  and  wearing 
black  cloth  up 
the  above  mentioned 
approaches put restrictions on the user and the environment 
for the systems to work. 

to  wrists.  All 

[Kang et al., 2005] declare that although several aspects 
of directing computers using human gestures/postures have 
been studied in the literature, gesture/posture recognition is 
still an open problem. This is due to significant challenges 
in  response  time,  reliability,  economical  constrains,  and 
natural intuitive gesticulation restrictions. 

Apart  from  the  above  mentioned  image  processing  ap-
proaches  for  feature  extraction,  appearance  based  method-
ologies have been reported primarily in the area of face rec-
ognition. Appearance based methods started with the work 
of  [Turk  and  Pentland,  1991]  on  face  recognition  using  a 
well known statistical technique called Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA). Since then, various extensions and modifi-
cations  have  been  proposed  to  the  PCA  method  for  face 
recognition,  resulting  in  2  Dimensional  PCA:  2D  PCA 
[Yang et al, 2004], 2 Directional 2 Dimensional PCA: (2D)2
PCA [Zhang and Zhou, 2005] and Diagonal PCA [Zhang et
al.,  2006]  methods  improving  the  recognition  rates  and 
memory  requirements  over  PCA.  Not  much  research  has 
been reported regarding the application of appearance based 
approach  for  sign  language  recognition,  [Birk  and  Moes-
lund, 1996] mention PCA based approach for sign language 
recognition  and  [Birk  et  al.,  1997]  gave  an  introductory 
work to fingerspelling recognition using PCA, although the 
system gave excellent results of 98.4% recognition rate (de-

fined  as  number  of  correct  recognitions  /  total  number  of 
test samples), the system was trained using sign images of 
single user with a black background. They reported the ex-
ploration of the system using two users and mention good 
results, but it should be taken that the hand structure of the 
second user is similar to the first user in light of the experi-
ments using more users in this work. 

In this paper, overcoming the complexity and variability 
of  signs  in  a  large dataset  thereby  improving  the perform-
ance of the PCA algorithm using standard image processing 
techniques  is  explored.  Image  processing  methods  like 
smoothing and contrast enhancement of the images are ap-
plied before using them in training and recognition phases. 
A  novel  approach  to  enhance  the  performance  of  the  ap-
pearance based methodology of using PCA in general con-
ditions is presented. No restrictions on the user and the envi-
ronment are imposed except that of a plain background. In 
fact, the proposed method overcomes the reduced perform-
ance  of  PCA  due  to  its  usage  in  general  environment.  An 
extensive  experimentation  is  done  using  PCA  for  recogni-
tion of fingerspelling alphabets on a large dataset created by 
capturing  24  fingerspelling  alphabets  made  by  20  users, 
with  6  samples  of  each  alphabet,  resulting  in  2880  signs. 
Experiments  show  that  the  proposed  image  processing 
methodology gives better results compared to conventional 
PCA.

The  paper  is  organised  as  follows.  Section  2  gives  an 
overview of PCA. The proposed method is described in Sec-
tion 3.  Section 4 contains the experimental details and re-
sults. The paper concludes with discussions and future ave-
nues in Section 5. 

2  Appearance based recognition using PCA: 

An Overview 

The concept of Eigen Faces, an appearance based recogni-
tion methodology was given by [Turk and Pentland, 1991]. 
The PCA procedure consists of an offline training phase and 
online recognition phase. 

In the training phase, the samples of the data on which the 
system needs to recognise are used to create an Eigen matrix 
which transforms the samples in the image space into points 
  be  a  set  of  n
s
in  the  Eigen  space.  Let 
image samples of size 
 taken for training the system. 
The image samples are taken as gray scale images and are 
transformed from 2-D matrix to 1-D column vector of size 
12N
 by placing the image matrix columns consecutively. 
The  transformed  vector  denotes  a  point  in  N2  dimensional 
space. These column vectors of n images are placed column 
wise to form the data matrix A of dimensions

basis of corresponding eigen values

The advantage of transforming the image into eigen space 
is that the dimensions required to represent the image can be 
reduced to m << N2, that is, the top m co-ordinate points of a 
transformed column vector in P matrix would represent the 
image with very little loss of information. 

In the recognition phase, the image I to be recognised is 
converted to 1-D vector form J as mentioned above and is 
projected on to the eigen space to get Z where

3  Proposed scheme 
PCA has been used for recognition on constrained dataset. 
Using PCA on real data with good recognition rate is a chal-
lenge. Towards that goal, the proposed scheme incorporates 
a pre-processing step in the training and recognition phase 
of the PCA model. The images are processed and then are 
used  for  training  and  recognition.  Smoothing  and  contrast 
enhancement  of  images  are  the  processing  steps  that  are 
proposed to be incorporated. 

A well known adaptive process known as wiener filter is 
used for smoothing, where the process adapts itself to local 
image variance. When the variance is large, the wiener filter 
performs  little  smoothing,  when  the  variance  is  small,  it 
performs  more  smoothing,  thereby preserving  edges  in the 
images.  The  results  are  often  better  than  linear  filtering, 
however, it does require more computation time than linear 
filtering.

The other proposed process extends the use of sobel filter. 
The sobel filter has the property of detecting the edges in the

horizontal or vertical direction as specified. In this work, it 
is first used to get the horizontal edge mapped image which 
is added back to the image to get an enhanced image. Hori-
zontal edge detecting sobel mask S is given as

Block wise application of the above mentioned mask on an 
image results in horizontal edge image. A filter can be de-
fined over block wise application of the mask on the image I
as to get an edge image E,

which is in turn is added to the original image I to get an 
enhanced image K, where  

EIK

The  resulting  image  K  is  used  in  training  and  recognition 
phases. 

Another image processing technique is histogram equali-
sation of images. This process results in a contrast adjusted 
image by increasing the local contrast. This process employs 
a monotonic, non-linear mapping which re-assigns the gray 
values of pixels in the input image such that the output im-
age contains a uniform distribution of gray values (i.e. a flat 
histogram).  This  technique  is  useful  in  comparison  proc-
esses because of its effective detail enhancement.  

A gray levels reduction technique is also proposed, it in-
creases the contrast in the image by reducing the number of 
gray levels in the image from 256 to 3 levels. This reduction 
in image gray levels is done by partitioning the gray level 
range into 3 sub ranges.

levels. If the gray levels are in predefined ranges, they are 
re-assigned to arbitrarily unique 3 gray levels L1, L2, and L3,

The resulting image I contains only 3 gray levels and high 
contrast. After extensive experimentation, the gray level sub 
range markers p and q are taken as 99 and 174 respectively 
and substituting gray levels L1, L2, and L3 are taken as 50, 
150  and  200  respectively.  All  the  images  used  in  the  ex-
periment have 256 gray levels. 

After application of the image processing technique, the 
resulting  images  are  used  for  the  training  and  recognition 
phases of the PCA model. 

Thus, the system training algorithm is as follows.  

Algorithm: Training 
Input: Fingerspelling training images  
Output: Fingerspelling image features, eigen vector matrix, 
feature matrix  
Method:
Step 1: Apply  any  of  the  discussed  pre-processing  tech-

niques to the training images. 

Step 2:  Transform  the  training  images  into  column  vector 
by  appending  the  columns  in  the  image  consecu-
tively.

Step 3: Build  the  data  matrix  A  of  image  column  vectors 
with  a  label  vector  L  having  the  corresponding  al-
phabet names of the image columns in A.

Step 4: Get mean column vector M of the data matrix A.
Step 5: Subtract mean M from each of the columns of A to 

result in mean centered matrix A.

Step 6: Compute the covariance matrix C of A as C = AAT.
Step 7: Obtain eigen vectors matrix E and eigen values vec-

Step 8: Rearrange the eigen vector columns in E as the cor-
responding eigen values in V are sorted in descend-
ing order. 

Step 9: Project the centered matrix A onto E to get feature

Training ends. 

Following is the algorithm designed for recognition.
Algorithm: Recognition 
Input: Fingerspelling image I to be recognised, number of 
dimensions to be considered m, feature matrix P, eigen vec-
tors matrix E, mean vector M, labels vector L
Output: Classification label of input image 
Method: 
Step 1: Apply the respective pre-processing technique on I
Step 2: Transform the processed image I into a column vec-
tor J by placing the columns in the image consecu-
tively.

Step 3: Subtract the mean vector M from the image vector J,

Step 4: Project the image vector J onto the eigen matrix E to 

get the feature vector Z= ETJ.

Step 5: Compute the Euclidian distance d between the fea-
ture vector Z and all the column vectors in the fea-
ture  matrix  P  considering  only  m  elements  in  the 
vectors  and  identify  the  column  having  the  mini-
mum distance d.

Step 6: Obtain the label from vector L corresponding to the 
column identified in P having the minimum distance 
to Z.

Recognition ends.

4 Experimental Results 
This  section  presents  the  results  of  the  experiments  con-
ducted to substantiate the performance enhancement of PCA 
using the proposed methodology. 

To  robustly  test  the  performance  of  the  proposed  work, 

large dataset of fingerspelling signs is built up. 

4.1 Dataset of fingerspelling signs 
User images were captured by a web cam with plain back-
ground. The alphabets ‚Äòj‚Äô and ‚Äòz‚Äô are dynamic signs consist-
ing of hand movement and thus, only static signs are con-
sidered in this work. Hence those two alphabet signs are not 
considered. Signs of 24 fingerspelling alphabets made by 20 

IJCAI-07

users were captured, with 6 samples of each alphabet, result-
ing in 2880 signs. A few sample images are given in Figure 
1.

The sign images were cropped to get hand area images, 
Figure 2 shows the result of cropping the sample images in 
Figure 1. Since PCA requires all the vectors to be of same 
size, all the images are resized to 
 dimensions, Fig-
ure  3  presents  the  resized  sample  images.  Figure  4  shows 
the result of application of smoothing using wiener filter to 
the samples images. Result of extended sobel filter applica-
tion is in Figure 5.  Histogram equalisation result is in Fig-
ure 6 and Figure 7 shows the result of gray levels reduction.

Out of the 6 samples for each alphabet from each user in 
the above mentioned dataset, 4 samples are considered for 
training  the  model  (totalling  1920  images).  Remaining  2 
samples for each alphabet from each user is considered for 
testing in recognition phase (totalling 960 images).  

During  recognition,  various  dimensions  (m)  are  consid-
ered while computing the Euclidian distance measure. Rec-
ognition rate is defined as the ratio of successful recognition 
of sample image to the number of samples used for testing 
in  recognition  phase.  Results  of  the  experiments  are  tabu-
lated in Table 8. The best performances of different methods 
are highlighted.

[Salzberg,  1997]  outlines  an  approach  for  experimental 
data setup to make a robust comparative analysis of classify-
ing  methods.  Similar  to  it,  the  dataset  of  signs  is  divided 
into different combinations of subsets for training and test-
ing phases of the methods. The dataset has 6 samples from 
each of the 20 users for each alphabet, out of which 4 sam-
ples are taken for training and 2 samples are taken for test-
ing. Totally we get 15 (=6C4 ) combinations for dividing the 
dataset  into  a  training  set  of  4  samples  and  remaining  2 
samples  for  testing  in  recognition  phase.  After  15  runs  of 
each algorithm on different sub sets, the average of the rec-
ognition  rates  is  taken  as  the  overall  performance  of  the 
method. 

This  experimental  setup  is used  to  test  the  effectiveness 
of the proposed method, it is used along with the standard 
techniques mentioned above for comparing the performance 
of  other  appearance  based  procedures  like  2D  PCA,  (2D)2
PCA  and  Diagonal  PCA  and  its  effectiveness  is  apparent 
from Table 10 and its chart in Figure 11.

From Table 8, Table 10, Figure 9 and Figure 11, it is ap-
parent  that  the  proposed  filter  procedure  increases  the 
performance of the appearance based methods. 

5 Discussion and Conclusion: 
Application of image processing techniques definitely helps 
in increasing the performance of appearance based method-
ologies  for  fingerspelling  recognition.  Techniques  like 
smoothing  and  contrast  enhancement  using  wiener  filter, 
extended sobel filter, histogram equalisation techniques and 
a novel gray levels reduction technique are applied resulting 
in  much  improvement  in  performance  of  PCA.  To  further 
show  its  effectiveness,  other  methods  like  2D  PCA,  (2D)2
PCA and Diagonal PCA are considered and their perform-
ances are compared, further reinforcing the effectiveness of 
the application of pre-processing techniques. 

Although the gray sub range bounds in gray level reduc-
tion  technique  are  chosen  experimentally,  further  work  in 
this direction would definitely give a basis for choosing the 
bounds and thereby making the technique adaptive.
