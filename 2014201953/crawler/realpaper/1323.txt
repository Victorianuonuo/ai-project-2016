Overview  of  the  Model 

It  has  been  assumed  that  t h is  a b i l i ty  to  struc­

ture  and  i n t e r p r et  social  actions  implies  that  the 
observer  is  acting  as  a  kind  of  extended  problem 
solving  system.  A  t y p i c al  problem  solving  system  is 
given  a  goal  and  then  attempts  to  f i nd  a  sequence  of 
legal  moves  that  transform  the  i n i t i al  state  i n to  a 
state  which  s a t i s f i es  the  goal  conditions.  The  obser­
ver  of  social  actions  assumes  that  the  actors  are 
engaged  in  problem  solving  a c t i v i ty  —  that  they  have 
goals  --  but  the  observer  does  not  t y p i c a l ly  know  what 
specific  goals  are  being  pursued.  Therefore,  the 
observer  must  possess  a  set  of  rules, 
which  i m p l i c i t ly  specify  the  set  of  psychologically 
permissable  goals. 
to  the  axioms  of  the  Try  component  of  the  axiom  of 
personal  causation. 

This  set  of  Try  rules  corresponds 

termed  Try  r u l e s, 

These  Try  rules  are  of  two  d i f f e r e nt  types.  The 

These  d i s p o s i t i o n al  rules  are  the  rules  which 

f i r st  type  are  termed  the  General  Try  rules.  These 
rules  represent  the  axioms  of  human  motivation  that  the 
observer  believes  to  be  applicable  to  a ll  persons. 
The  hedonism  rule  mentioned  previously  is  an  example 
of  a  r u le  of  t h is  type. 
The  second  type  of  Try  rules 
are  termed  Dispositional  Try  rules. 
In  general,  these 
l a t t er  rules  are  applied  only  if  the  General  Try  rules 
f a i l. 
are  used  to  make  inferences  concerning  the  personality 
of  the  actors,  and  these  rules  are  the  source  of  the 
naive  theory  of  personality.  An  example  w i ll  help  to 
c l a r i fy  t h is  d i s t i n c t i o n.  Most  persons  that  we  know 
act  honestly  most  of  the  time.  Nonetheless,  very  few 
of  us  would  characterize  the  majority  of  persons  whom 
we  know  as  possessing  the  t r a it

i n f e r r i ng  that  a  person  is  honest.  However,

lose  nothing  from  acting  dishonestly,

must  possess  these  consistency  rules  which  function  as 
a  kind  of  meta-theory  of  personality  organization. 
If 
these  rules  are  violated  we  tend  to  look  deeper  i n to 
the  situation  in  search  of  a  more  acceptable  interpre­
t a t i o n.  Thus,  t h is  set  of  rules  acts  as  a  kind  of

rules. 

Representation  o_f  Actions,  Persons  and  Situations 

Natural 

language  is  the  major  system  of  expression 

to  discuss  plans, 

used  to  inform  others  of  intentions, 
and  to  t e ll  stories.  Gesture,  f a c i al  expression, 
posture  and  intonation  are  also  used  to  communicate 
intention  and  emotion,  but  the  subtleties  of  these 
systems  of  expression  are  beyond  the  scope  of  our 
model.  For  these  reasons,  we  have  looked  to  natural 
language  for  an  appropriate  set  of  concepts  and 
properties  for  representing  actions,  persons  and 
situations.  The  underlying  assumption  that  has  been 
adopted 
of  persons  and  verbs  describing  interpersonal  actions 
are  related  in  a  systematic  fashion  and  that  much  of

f a l l i ng  into  two  general  classes. 
The  f i r st  class 
specifies  either  the  existence  of  a  property  of  an 
e n t i ty  or  a  r e l a t i on  between  e n t i t i e s.  Examples  of 
verbs  used  to  communicate  the  existence  of  properties 
of  persons  are:  has,  owns,  knows,  believes, 
t o,  wants,  and  needs.  Verbs  specifying  the  existence 
of  relations  between  persons  are  exemplified  by  the 
verbs:  married  t o,  son  of, 
l i k e s,  hates, 
and  dominates.  The  second  class  of  verbs  are  those 
which  can  be  used  to  describe  interpersonal  actions. 
These  include  verbs  usually  employed  to  describe  the 
exchange  of  physical  objects  (e.g.  give,  take,  buy, 
s e l l,  steal)  as  well  as  verbs  used  to  describe  the 
exchange  of  information  (e.g. 
t e l l,  ask,  command, 
i n s u l t,  beg,  and  threaten).  Aside  from  these  actions 
of  exchange  there  are  also  verbs  used  to  denote  move­
ment,  ingestion,  and  so  on.  However,  the  exchange 
acts  appear  to  be  the  most  c r u c i a l ly  involved  in 
describing  social  actions. 
it  is

most  attention. 

For  t h is  reason, 

The  verbs  specifying  properties  and  relations 

For 

and  those  denoting  action  are  related  in  an  i n t e r e s t­
ing  way.  Verbs  of  action  generally  presuppose  the 
existence  of  certain  properties  in  the  s i t u a t i o n. 
example,  give  presupposes  that  the  actor  intends  the 
action  and  that  the  actor  possesses  the  object  which 
is  being  given.  Furthermore,  each  action  verb  carries 
with  it  some  information  concerning  the  consequences 
that  necessarily  or  possibly  result  after  the  action 
has  been  taken.  This  observation  supports  the 
assumption  that  underlying  each  action  verb  is  know­
ledge  of  an  action  schema  which  defines  a  p a r t i al 
function  consisting  of  a  set  of  antecedent  properties 
that  must  hold  immediately  p r i or  to  the  occurrence  of 
the  act  and  a  set  of  consequent  properties  that  may 
hold  after  the  action  has  been  taken.  Stated  more 
formally,  an  act  schema  is  represented  as: 

Name  Act 

[ E1. E2. . .)  -*-  (Try  Flag)  *  { P C}  /  (0C) 

where  (0C)  ■  {NOC}  u  {POC).  The  action  schema  consists

the  set  {PC}  which  contains  the  l i st  of

a  set  of  dummy  arguments 
( E1, E2, . , .)  which  r e s t r i ct 
the  class  of  e n t i t i es  that  can  be  substituted  as 
actor,  r e c i p i e n t,  object,  and  instrument  of  the  act. 
The  r i g ht  side  includes  the  Try  Flag  whose  value  is 
non-nil 
i n t e n t i on  on  the  part 
of  the  actor, 
preconditions  on  the  act,  and  the  set  {OC}  which

A  p a r t i c u l ar  person  is  represented  as  a  l i st

structure  is  d i f f e r e n t i a t ed

examples  of  p a r t i c u l ar  properties  of  that  class.

The  dispositional  properties  are  also  related  to 

the  operation  of  the  Try  component.  A  disposition 
is  associated  with  a  person  if  a  p a r t i c u l ar  Disposi­

action  of  the  person.  A  dispositional  property  such 
as  h e l p f ul  or  honest  is  the  memory  tag  for  t h is  pre­

d i s p o s i t i o n al  property  is  a  set  of  coordinates  giving 
the  location  of  the  disposition  in  an  implicational 
space  of  disposition  terms.  These  coordinates  are

Try  Rules 

Four  types  of  General  Try  rules  and  the  Disposi­

t i o n al  Try  rules  have  been  developed.  The  General 
Try  rules  include  hedonism,  extended  hedonism, 
r e c i p r o c i ty  and  normative  rules.  Hedonism  is  the 
common-sense  notion  that  actions  may  be  taken  because 
outcomes  beneficial  to  the  actor  are  expected  to 
r e s u l t.  Extended  hedonism  generalizes  t h is  notion 
to  include  the  p o s s i b i l i ty  that  the  actor  expects 
the  outcomes  to  benefit  some  person  connected  to  the 
actor  by  a  positive  u n it  or  sentiment  r e l a t i o n, 
for 
example  a  son  or  a  f r i e n d.  The  core  idea  of  r e c i­
procity  is  that  persons  are  expected  to  respond  in 
kind  to  the  actions  of  others.  Normative  rules  repre­
sent  b e l i e fs  about  c u l t u r al  or  legal  norms  that  apply

that  John's  wife  is  in  need  of  an  operation  and  that
