Abstract 

This  paper  describes  an  a r t i f i c i al 

t a c t i le  sense  with 

multi-elements  that  not  only  takes  the  pressure  i n f o r(cid:173)
mation  without  crushing  an  object 
in  the  hand,  but  also 
discriminates  one  pattern  from  another  on  the  surfaces 
being  in  touch  therewith. 

The  eigenvalue  of  pattern  of  stress  d i s t r i b u t i on  on 

the  surface  of  the  receptor  elements  is  derived  from 
the  lielmholtz  equation.  The  element  spacing  of  receptor 
is  designed  by  using  the  r e l a t i ve  error  of  the  eigen(cid:173)
value  of  the  sampled  pattern  as  the  design  specifica(cid:173)

A  simple  experiment  classifying  cylinders,  trigonal

Introduction 

Some  hand-eye  systems  and  manipulators  have  already 
been  constructed.  These  systems  accept  the  information 
for  satisfying 
the  request  of  task  s u f f i c i e n t l y,  which 
is  given  by  a  basic  behavioral  pattern  of  the  system  or 
relationship  between  an  object  and  a  t ip  of  finger.  The 
receptors  of  the  a r t i f i c i al 
the  contact  information  with  an  object  are  a  number  of 
micro  switches,  s t r a in  gauge  and  conductive  rubber. 
These  elements  are  used  for  detecting  the  contact  and 
the  pressure  information  without  crushing  the  object

t a c t i le  sense 

As  the  grasped  object  deforms  the  surface  of  the  ar(cid:173)

t a c t i le  sense, 

i ts  stress  d i s t r i b u t i on 

t i f i c i al 
is  given  by  the  output  of  the  t a c t i le  receptors.  A 
schematic  diagram  of  these  receptors  is  shown  in  F i g . l. 
The  receptor  elements  or  input  are  arranged  at  the  node

In  case  of  the  a r t i f i c i al 

t a c t i le  sense  being  ar(cid:173)
ranged  close  to  each  other,  these  inner  potential  of 
the  receptors  may  be  considered  to  be  the  potential 

d i s t r i b u t i on  V(  x,y,z  ).  The  threshold  is  also  consid(cid:173)

each  threshold  6.  of  receptors  has  the  same  value,  the

Then,  comparing  the  inner  potential  with  the  thresh(cid:173)

obtained  among  them  as  shown  in  the  next  section.

For  the  threshold  d i s t r i b u t i on  P{  B.  )  corresponding 

to  the  hyperplane  of  the  potential  d i s t r i b u t i on  V(x,y,

described  by  the  d i f f e r e n t i al  geometrical  concept. 

Let  us  define  a  point  of  contact  p  between  P(  6.  ) 

and  V(  x,y,z  ).  We  define  the  second  ?undamental 
d i f f e r e n t i al 
form  at  a  point  of  contact  p  on  the 
threshold  d i s t r i b u t i o n.  The  second  fundamental  quantity 
is  derived  from  i ts  near  surface  of  V(  x,y,z  )  at  a 
point  of  contact  p

Let  us  suppose  the  surface  of  the  object  is  convex 
or  concave  within  the  region  of  surface  of  the  t a c t i le

4.  Design  method  for  spacing  the  receptor  elements 

The  surface  of  the  object  touching  with  the  a r t i f i(cid:173)

the 
c i al  t a c t i le  sense  has  some  pattern  of  shape.  Then, 
pattern  of  shape  is  discriminated  as  a  two-dimensional 
pattern  which  is  received  by  the  receptors  as  shown  in 
Fig.2.  The  two-dimensional  pattern  is  regarded  as  a 
c i r c l e,  square  or  i ts  modification. 
is  desirable 
that  the  pattern  can  be  discriminated  precisely  by  as 
few  receptors  as  possible.  The  problem  of  spacing  and 
sampling  of  the  two-dimensional  patterns  have  not  been 
subjected  to  such  extensive  investigations.  G.C.Cheng 
and  R.S.  Ledley  discussed  the  error  analysis,  that

thickness,  and  an  element  is  3min  in  diameter,  and  the 
spacing  is  h  =  4mm.  Therefore,  in  case  of  the  c i r c u l ar

The  a r t i f i c i al  hand  with  the  a r t i f i c i al  t a c t i le 

sense  described  above  is  controlled  sequentially  by  the 
following  steps(  F i g . 9 ).

is  given  to  the  input  of  a  trainable  pattern 

The  grasped  object  is  a  trigonal  prism(  90mm  on  a

used  in  the  learning  process  as  shown  in  F i g . l l.  We 
have  t r i ed  a  pattern  c l a s s i f i c a t i on  by  using  the  above 
adjusted  weights  of  the  trainable  pattern  c l a s s i f i er
