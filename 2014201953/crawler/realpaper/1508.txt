Third, 

the  focus  representation  must 

include 

mechanisms  for  s h i f t i ng  focus.  As  successive 
utterances  in  a  discourse  are  i n t e r p r e t e d, 
the 
items  in 
focus  change.  S h i f ts  of  focus  occur  both 
gradually  with  time,  and  more  abruptly  with  change 
of  t o p i c.  Not  only  the  objects  in 
focus,  but  also 
the  p a r t i c u l ar  way  of  viewing  them,  can  change. 
For  example,  a  doctor  can  be  viewed  as  a  member  of 
the  medical  profession,  or  aA  having  a  r o le  in  a 
family.
