Abstract 

This paper compares alternative approaches to pose 
estimation using visual cues from the environment. 
We examine approaches that derive pose estimates 
from  global  image  properties,  such  as principal 
components analysis (PCA) versus from local im(cid:173)
age properties, commonly referred to as landmarks. 
We also consider the failure-modes of the different 
methods.  Our work is validated with experimental 
results. 

Introduction 

1 
A considerable amount of research has been conducted on 
the problem of using vision to localize a robot in a known 
environment.  Two basic approaches have emerged; the first 
correlates global properties of the image, such as a principal 
components subspace projection; whereas the second corre(cid:173)
lates a set of local properties, or landmarks.  Each approach 
has its own strengths and weaknesses, and is based on its own 
assumptions about the environment. It is often argued that lo(cid:173)
cal feature-based representations are more robust to scene dy(cid:173)
namics and illumination variation than globally-derived rep(cid:173)
resentations. It is also widely assumed that feature-based ap(cid:173)
proaches require less online computation time than global ap(cid:173)
proaches. 

The goal of this paper is to critically examine a selection 
of image-based pose estimation methods and compare them 
for their performance under a variety of conditions. We con(cid:173)
sider accuracy and running time as the two major indicators 
of performance. 

2  Previous Work 
Pose estimation from monocular vision data is non-intrusive 
and conceptually appealing as a research direction.  Posi(cid:173)
tion estimation entails a combination of estimating local dis(cid:173)
placement with recognizing familiar locations.  It has been 
approached as both a coarse place-recognition problem (e.g. 
based on color histograms for familiar locations [Ulrich and 
Nourbakhsh, 2000]) and also as a problem of recognizing a 
set of local features associated with a specific location (for ex(cid:173)
ample [Se et al., 2002]). In several approaches, authors have 
suggested interpolating between familiar locations to produce 

a position estimate more accurate than the density of training 
data, using either global image features ([Nayar et al., 1994; 
Pourraz and Crowley,  1999]) or sets of local image features 
([Sim and Dudek, 2001]). In this paper we compare the per(cid:173)
formance of some of these alternatives.. 

3  Localization Methods 
Framework  We assume the same framework for all of the 
methods presented below. First, a set of training images has 
been  collected  from  known  poses  in  the  environment.  A 
model, or models, are constructed by building an interpolant 
over the set of training poses. We employ bilinear interpola(cid:173)
tion of the observation space over the Delaunay triangulation 
of the pose space.  The cost of constructing the triangulation 
and any other preprocessing of the training images (such as 
tracking features) is referred to as the offline cost. 

When a pose estimate is required, a probability distribution 
is computed using a multi-resolution grid-based discretiza(cid:173)
tion of the pose  space.  At each grid position  a predicted 
observation is generated and compared with the actual ob(cid:173)
servation.  The probability is computed using Bayes'  Rule, 
whereby, assuming a uniform prior, the probability of a pose 
q is proportional to the probability of the observation z given 
the pose: 

p{q\z) oc p{z\q) 

Once a cell with maximal probability is determined, a higher 
resolution discretization is computed in the neighborhood of 
that cell, and the process recurses until a desired level of res(cid:173)
olution is achieved.  By setting the maximum discretization 
to a fixed value, we fix the number of times the likelihood 
function is evaluated, thus allowing us to benchmark the per(cid:173)
formance of the method.  This running time is referred to as 
the online cost. 

3.1  Global Methods 
Edge Density  Out first globally-based method computes a 
map of the local edge density of the image.  The density is 
approximated by convolving the image edge map with a wide 
(33 pixels) Gaussian kernel.  The edge map is relatively re(cid:173)
sistant to illumination changes, and measuring edge density 
propagates edge information locally. Depending on the width 
of the kernel,  a linear combination  of neighboring training 
edge densities can loosely approximate the motion of edges 
as the camera moves.

Principal Components  PCA operates by computing a low-
dimensional  subspace  of the  space  spanned  by  the  training 
images.  For this  work,  we employ the first twenty principal 
components.  When  pose  likelihoods  are  computed  online, 
only  the  low-dimensional  projections  of the  training  inputs 
are interpolated. The input observation must be projected into 
the subspace; an operation that is performed once; and subse(cid:173)
quent comparisons are between low-dimensional vectors. 

Local  Methods 

3.2 
The alternative to computing global  image  features is to ex(cid:173)
tract a set of local  image  features,  or landmarks,  and model 
their behavior as a function of position.  Local features must 
be selected and tracked, and subsequently they are modeled. 
Finally, when online they must be matched to features in the 
input observation.  Once matching  is  complete,  the  individ(cid:173)
ual  estimates from different landmarks must be combined in 
a robust manner. 

We use the landmark-based method proposed by Sim and 
Dudek [Sim and Dudek, 2001]. That model selects landmarks 
using saliency, and, once they are tracked across the training 
space, models the landmark behaviors as a function of pose. 
The  models compute a linear interpolant of the landmark  at(cid:173)
tributes over the triangulation of the pose space. 

We employ two versions of the landmark model;  the first, 
referred  to  as  DynamicLM  models  the  appearance  of the 
landmarks as a function of pose, and thus matching may re(cid:173)
quire  several  instantiations  of the  landmark  before  it  is  suc(cid:173)
cessfully matched. The second, referred to as FixedLM, fixes 
the landmark appearance, speeding up the matching, but re(cid:173)
ducing the range of poses that the landmark can model.

Table  1:  Localization results for Normal set. 

Training  We  used  a robot to collect  121  images  in  a  grid 
pattern at 20cm intervals, over a 2m by 2m area (Figure  la)). 
Ground truth was obtained by mounting a laser pointer on the 
robot  and  measuring  by  hand  the position  of the  laser point 
on the floor.  As such, the ground truth is accurate to ~0.5cm. 
The same set of training images was provided to each  lo(cid:173)
calization method for preprocessing and training, and the run(cid:173)
ning times for this phase were recorded. 

Verification  A set of 29 verification images were collected 
with the robot from random locations at the same orientation 
as the training images.  Ground truth was measured by hand. 
The images were collected under the same illumination con(cid:173)
ditions  and  observed  the  same  static  scene.  These  images 
constitute our Normal verification  set.  Gaussian  white noise 
was added to these  images to create a Noisy verification  set 
(Figure  la)),  and  a  set  of occluders  were  randomly  painted 
into  the  images  to  generate  two  Occlusion  sets  (Figure  lb) 
and  lc)).  The  first  set  of occluders  consists  of white  noise, 
and the second consists of solid tiles. 

A  second  set  of  ten  images  was  collected  under  low-
light  conditions  from  random  locations.  Ground  truth  was 
recorded by hand. These images are referred to as the Illumi(cid:173)
nation verification set (Figure  Id)). 

Each localization method was applied to each verification 
set,  and  the  mean  error  between  the  maximum-likelihood 
(ML)  estimate  and  ground  truth  was  compiled  on  a  per-
method, per-set basis.  The computational cost of preprocess(cid:173)
ing the input images and computing the ML estimate was also 
recorded.  For  each  image,  the  multi-resolution  grids  were 
evaluated at a total of 2300 distinct poses.

Images  from  a)  the  training  set  (top,left),  b) 
theNoisy verification set (top,right), c) the Occlusion set with 
noisy occluders (middle,left), d) the Occlusion set with solid 
occluders (middle,right), and e) the Illumination set (bottom). 

Measuring  performance  Consider  the  expected  error us(cid:173)
ing  a  method  that  selects  the  nearest  training  image  with 
100% accuracy.  This magic number can be computed to be 
7.6cm  for our experiments.  A mean error of less than  7.6cm 
could be considered to be successful at interpolating over the 
training  set. 
In  practice  a  nearest-neighbor  implementation 
is unlikely to be perfect, and will generate larger errors.  We 
have  applied  a  nearest  neighbor  (NN)  approach  to  the  two 
global  methods on the Normal set.

ning  times  are  depicted.  For  the  two  global  methods,  near(cid:173)
est  neighbor  results  are  also  tabulated  for  comparison.  Only 
the  PCA  and  FixedLM  methods  approach  the  magic  number. 
The  nearest  neighbor  approaches  perform  poorly  against  the 
magic  number.  As  expected,  PCA  presents  a  large  offline 
computational  cost,  but  very  low  online  cost. 

Table  2  depicts  the  results  for  the  Noisy  set. 

In  the  case 
of the  landmark-based  approach,  we  have  indicated  error  re(cid:173)
sults  for  only  those  images  where  at  least  one  landmark  was 
successfully  matched.  The  number  of estimates  is  indicated 
in  the  last  column,  out  of the  total  number of verification  im(cid:173)
ages.  Both  global  methods  saw  an  improvement  in  perfor(cid:173)
mance. 

Table  3  depicts  the  results  for  the  Occlusion  set  with  noisy 
occluders.  The  local  methods  perform  significantly  worse, 
despite  improved  matching output in the FixedLM case.  PCA 
continues  to  perform  well,  but  the  edge  density  approach  is 
confounded  by  the  introduction  of regions  of high  edge  den(cid:173)
sity. 

Table  4  depicts  the  results  for  the  Occlusion  set  with  solid 
occluders.  The  local  methods  demonstrate  a  degradation  in 
performance,  although  not as  great as  for the  white  noise  oc(cid:173)
cluders.  There  is  also  a  reversal  in  performance  for PCA  ver(cid:173)
sus  Edge  Density. 

Table 5  indicates the results under altered illumination con(cid:173)
ditions.  While  all  of the  methods  perform  poorly,  the  Edge 
Density  approach  suffers  the  least  degradation.

6  Discussion and Conclusions 
Both  PCA  and  the  landmark-based  methods  present  signifi(cid:173)
cant  offline  costs,  calling  into  question  their  practicality  for 
applications  such  as  simultaneous  localization  and  mapping. 
However,  PCA  was  robust  to  some  types  of adverse  imaging 
conditions,  and  was  demonstrably  faster  in  computing  online 
pose  estimates. 

While  the  Edge  Density  method  was  less  accurate  than 
PCA,  it  took  significantly  less  time  to  train,  at  the  cost  of 
slower  online  performance.  However,  the  ongoing  increase 
in  CPU  speeds  makes  global  methods  such  as  these  increas(cid:173)
ingly  practical. 

Finally,  the  landmark-based  methods  presented  a  smooth 
degradation  in  performance  as  the  imaging  conditions  be(cid:173)
came  increasingly  adverse. 
In  general,  these  methods  per(cid:173)
formed  well,  but  were  significantly  more  expensive  online 
due  to  the  cost  of  matching  and  frequent  invocation  of  the 
landmark  prediction  model.  Online  performance  of these  ap(cid:173)
proaches  depends  to  a  large  extent  on  the  nature  of the  pre(cid:173)
diction  model  itself. 

We  have  presented  a  comparison  of  several  localization 
methods  in  a known  environment against  a variety  of imaging 
conditions.  The  results  challenge  some  widely  held  assump(cid:173)
tions  about  the  various  advantages  and  disadvantages  of local 
and  global  methods.
