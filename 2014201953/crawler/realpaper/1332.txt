Abstract 

The  recovery  of  straight  picture  edges 

from  digitisations  of  scenes  containing  poly-
hedra  ( ' l i ne  finding')  is  central  to  the 
functioning  of  scene  analysis  programs. 
While  recognising  that  recovery  properly 
involves  a  computational  mobilisation  of  a 
great  deal  of  knowledge-supported  context, 
there  remain  some  "basic  issues  of  represent(cid:173)
ation  which  govern  the  way  in  which  the 
primary  data  -  grey  levels  -  are  addressed. 
The  paper  describes  a  parametric  representa(cid:173)
tion  of  straight  picture  edges  and  i ts 
procedural  deployment  in  the  recovery  of 
edges  from  digitisations  of  scenes  whose 
contents  arc  essentially  polyhedra  with 
strong  visible  shadows.

Scene  Analysis 

interpretation  of  pictures  in  the 

Contemporary  thinking  in  scene  analysis 
is  focussed  primarily  upon  efforts  to  deploy 
higher  level  knowledge,  e.g.  of  support, 
l i g h t i ng  and  scene  composition12  to  achieve  an 
'integrated' 
form  of  grey  scale  data  from  TV  cameras  or 
comparable  picture  d i g i t i s e r s.  The  need  to 
involve  such  knowledge  has  "become  progress(cid:173)
ively  more  apparent  as  line  and  region 
finders10  5  2  1  have  demonstrated  that  a 
pass-oriented  approach  to  the  recovery  of 
edges  and  surfaces  is  only  p a r t i a l ly  success(cid:173)
f u l. 

'  The  scenes 

Our  own  studies  are  focussed  primarily 
upon  this  same  endeavour:  a  crucial  feature 
of  our  research  is  the  formulation  of  a  task 
in  which  there  is  a  rich  "but  hopefully 
tractable  range  of  knowledge  which  could  "be 
mobilised  in  such  an  integrated  analysis. 
The  task  had  i ts  origins  in  part  in  the 
dictum  we  attribute  to  Guzman7  ' if  you 
recognize  a  foot  you  know  where  (in  the 
picture)  to  look  for  a  leg 
we  are  working  on  are  polyhedral  in  content 
but  polyhedra  constrained  to  form  a  puppet 
figure  ( F i g . l) 
to  bear  just  that  sense  of  context  which 
Guzman  evokes,  in  order  to  assist  the  proces(cid:173)
sing  of  some  picture  or  scene  fragment. 
Contemporary  programs  e.g.  Falk£  do  just 
this  but  within  the  r e s t r i c t i on  that  context 
can  only  be  mobilised  to  help  in  identifying 
the  elements  of  a  single  body  (of  which  Falk 
has  9  distinct  models)  except  for  the 
contextual  inferences  provided  by  the  requir(cid:173)
ement  that  bodies  be  simply  supported. 
Winston's  account12  of  Finin's  work  goes 
beyond  Falk  in  precisely  the  direction  we 
have  adumbrated  although  it  is  unclear  what 
range  of  architectures  is  being  contemplated 
beyond  the  'arch'  he  describee. 

In  so  doing  we  hope  to  bring 

Notwithstanding  these  attempts  to 

543 

reformulate  approaches  to  scene  analysis  as 
integrated  or  '  heterarchical'  (as  epposed  to 
• hierarchical'  pass-oriented  schemes)  there 
remains  a  clear  requirement  for  procedures 
which  are  capable  -  with  or  without  context  -
of  recovering  three-dimensionally  significant 
entities  in  the  primary  picture  data.  One 
recent  attempt  to  mobilise  context  to  assist 
a  line  finder  is  described  by  Shirai11  . 
After  an  i n i t i al  'pass'  to  recover  an  outer 
contour  of  the  group  (or  groups)  of  objects 
visible in  the  scene,  the  line  finder  is 
d'reefed  to  significant  locations  e.g.  con(cid:173)
cavities,  in  this  contour  as  the  origin  of  a 
search  for  further  edges.  Heuristics  of 
various  sorts  e.g.  'Jock  for  an  edge  parallel 
to  one  already  found'  are  used  to  further 
constrain  the  direction  of  the  search.  The 
search  i t s e lf  proceeds  from  the  immed iate 
v i c i n i ty  of  that  location. 
typical  scenes  suggests  that  at  many  such 
locations  on  an  edge,  the  evidence  may  be 
meagre  although  elsewhere  along  i ts  length 
the  evidence  is  much  stronger.  Thus  a  search 
i n i t i a t ed  by  a  program  such  as  Shirai's  may 
i'ail  because  it  has  a  very  myopic  way  of 
addressing  the  picture  space  to  find  edges. 
This  paper  is  concerned  primarily  with  a  study 
of  an  alternative  to  this  locai  search 
strategy,  by  exploiting  the  collinearity  of 
the  feature  points  making  up  a  straight 
picture  edge  as  an  addressing  mechanism. 

Inspection  of 

The  exploitation  of  this  property  to 

find  straight  lines  is  not  in  i t s e lf  original. 
Both  Duda  and  Hart*  and  Griffith6,  describe  a 
parameter!sation  of  feature-point  data  which 
is  of  assistance  in  recovering  straight  lines. 
Indeed  our  own  work  derives  directly  from 
that  of  Duda  and  Hart.  These  earlier  workers 
however  leave  many  problems  unresolved  (e.g. 
Duda  and  Hart  p.13  c o l. 2)  not  least  of  which 
is  the  nature  of  the  methods  by  which  the 
parameterised  data  is  to  be  concatenated  into 
1ines.  The  study  which  we  have  carried  out 
provides  a  fresh  perspective  from  which  to 
view  the  'myopia'  of  line  finders  and  gives 
at  the  same  time  a  more  detailed  picture  of 
the  d i f f i c u l t j es  that  remain.

The  Line  Finding  Process 

2 . 1.  The Data. 

The  data  with  which  we  have  worked 

derive  from  positive  photographs  of  scenes  l it 
by  a  single  l i g ht  source.  Our  primary  concern 
is  with  scenes  involving  the  puppet  figure 
which  is  painted  a  uniform  matt  grey,  althougi 
we  have  done  some  work  on  matt  white  poly(cid:173)
hedral  blocks.  The  photograph  is  digitised 
by  a  f l y i ng  spot  scanner* with  a  linear
