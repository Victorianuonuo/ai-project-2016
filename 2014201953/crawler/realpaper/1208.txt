How  hard  a  problem  can  you  solve?  The  answer 

the  d i f f i c u l ty  of  a

v e r 's  education  and  i n t e l l i g e n ce  alone.  We  are 
already  in  an  era  where  very  s u b s t a n t i al  and  ma-
neuverable  on-line  systems  can  g r e a t ly  enhance  our 
c a p a b i l i t i e s.  Consequently, 
problem  must  now  be  measured  by  i ts  distance  from 
the  combined  powers  of  a  man-machine  problem-sol(cid:173)

s t a r t i ng  man-machine  combination  to  be  used  exper(cid:173)

The  development  of  i n t e r a c t i ve  software  and 
hardware  to  permit  convenient  man-machine  commun(cid:173)

years.  Hardware  which  provides  the  channels  f or 
t h is  communication  necessarily  relates 
to  man's 
The  software  supporting  t h is

communication  must  consist  of  two  p a r t s: 
one 
which  extracts  the  programmatic 
the  man's  inputs  to  the  computer  system  and  the 
other  which  generates  outputs  perceivable  by  man's 
senses. 
The  nature  of  these  outputs  depends  upon 
the  computer's  programmatic  perception  and  r e(cid:173)
sponse  to  i ts  own  i n t e r n al  data,  program,  and  sta(cid:173)

many  of  us  engaged  in  b u i l d i ng  i n t e r a c t i ve  sys(cid:173)

There  are  many  reasons  f or  t h is  concern:

it  is  often  the  most  distinctive  of  the  three. 
The  mid  string  is  the  most  familiar  of  the  three 
in  terms  of  voice;  when  combined  with  the  treble, 
it  makes  a  voice  much  like  that  recorded  in  an 
anechoic  chamber.  The  bass  is  not  often  of  dis(cid:173)
tinctive  importance;  it  represents  much  of  the 
acoustic  interaction  of  the  room,  the  voice,  and 
the  recording  system. 
In  our  on-line  speech  sys(cid:173)
tem  we  have  included  the  f a c i l i ty  for  programma(cid:173)
t i c a l ly  constructing  d i g i t al  f i l t e r s.  Since  we 
are  s t i ll  in  the  study  phase,  we  have  the  freedom 
to  carefully  observe  a  sample  word  and  experimen(cid:173)
t a l ly  select  a  means  of  separating  out  the  strings. 
In  crude  terms,  the  treble  is  everything  above 
1800  Hertz,  the  bass  is  everything  below  450 
Hertz,  and  the  mid  is  everything  between.  A  good 
test  for  completeness  of  separation  into  strings 
is  that  the  second  derivative  of  each  of  the  three 
must  remain  in  the  same  category  as  the  original 
string,  or  the  separation  is  incomplete. 

Each  string  is  then  decomposed  into  i ts  con(cid:173)

stituent  elementary  sounds  by  the  method  of  evacu-

jj  ation,  i . e .,  f i r st  remove  those  of  primary  i n f l u(cid:173)
ence  from  the  string  by  insisting  that  after  re(cid:173)
moval  of  a  wave  function,  the  residue  string  is  of 
minimum  amplitude  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  one 
removed.  After  each  evacuation  the  residue  is  a 
similar  string  of  smaller  amplitude,  and  the  pro(cid:173)
cess  can  be  repeated. 
In  Figure  5.  we  show  the 
three  strings,  in  the  decomposition  of  the  signal 
produced  by  a  male  voice  saying  "Corby".  As  is 
apparent  from  this  figure,  the  frequency  is  not 
constant  across  a  string,  but  when  properly  mea(cid:173)
sured  for  individual  elementary  sounds  w i ll  pro(cid:173)
vide  an  important  parameter  for  sorting  these 
sounds.  The  evacuation  method  is  shown  in  Fig(cid:173)
ure  6.  for  the  mid  string  of  "Corby"  during  the 
f i r st  210  ms.  Figure  7.  shows  the  sum  of  the 
f i r st  two  evacuations  in  comparison  with  the  o r i(cid:173)
ginal  mid  string. 

Each  elementary  string  f(t)  can  be  expressed 
as  a  sum  of  elementary  sounds  through  the  evacua(cid:173)
tion  process.  This  sum  takes  the  form
