Task  Environment 

The  program  accepts  as 

input  some  representation  of 

the  target  compound  together  w i th  a  l i st  of  conditions 
and  constraints  that  must  govern  the  proposed  syntheses 
[Figure  l ],  A  l i st  of  compounds  that  are  commercially 
available  (along  w i th  indications  of  cost  and 
a v a i l a b i l i t y)  can  "be  consulted.  A  reaction  l i b r a ry 
containing  generalized  procedures 
is  supplied  to  the 
program.  The  output 
is  a  set  of  proposed  syntheses, 
each  being  a  v a l id  reaction  pathway 
compounds  to  the  target  molecule.  The  syntheses  are 
arrived  at  by  means  of  strategic  exploration  of  an 
AND-OR  search  space.  The  design  of  the  search  strategy 
concerns  us  here.

toward 
simply, 
the  task  of  the  synthesis  search  is  to  explore 
a l t e r n a t i ve  routes  of  synthesis  and  develop  a  problem 
solving  t r ee  r i ch  in  information,  having  several 
'good' 
complete  syntheses.  The  success  of  the  program  is  not 
to  be  Judged  solely  on  the  number  or  v a r i e ty  of 
completed  syntheses,  but  w i th  the  understanding  t h at 
paths  of  exploration  not  completed  by  the  program  are

The  chemist  examines  the  molecule  and  recognizes 

several  s t r u c t u r al  features  such  as  the  presence  of 
the  six-membered  r i ng  w i th  three  i n t e r n al  double  bonds 
(usually  called  the  phenyl  group).  Other  noticeable 
features  are  the  ketone,>C=0.  and  o l e f in  bond, 
-CH=CH-  .  What  is  defined  as  a  feature  depends  upon 
the  purpose  of  the  examination  and  the  chemical 
knowledge  one  possesses.  We  use  the  term  SYNTHEME  to

Among  the  features  of  the  molecule,  the  phenyl

Thus, 

The  chemist  knows  of  several  reactions  that  can 

synthesize  an  o l e f in  bond  and  several  that  can 
synthesize  the  ketone  syntheme.  He  can  consider  each 
of  these  as  the  t r i al  l a st  step  of  the  synthesis 
sequence  he  is  seeking.

reaction  schemata  c a l l ed  the  REACTION  LIBRARY.  The 
reaction  schemata  are  grouped  i n to  reaction  chapters

for  the  target  and  subgoal  molecules.  The 

reaction  schema  is  provided  w i th  a  set  of  tests  to  be 
performed  on  the  target  molecule  and  s t r u c t u r al 
patterns 
tests  embody  many  of  the  chemical  h e u r i s t i cs  that 
guide  the  program.  Based  on  the  r e s u l ts  of  some  of  the 
tests  the  program  may  r e j e ct  the  reaction  schema.  Each 
schema  has  an  a  p r i o ri  assignment  of  merit  r a t i n g. 
Based  on  the  r e s u l ts  of  other  tests  the  program  may 
a l t er  the  merit  r a t i ng  to  r e f l e ct  the  s u i t a b i l i ty  of  the 
schema  to  the  specific  target  molecule. 

We  may  represent  the  a l t e r n a t i ve  courses  of 
syntheses  developed  for  the  target  molecule  by  a 
PROBLEM  SOLVING  GRAPH  {Figure  3 ).  The  target  molecule 
is  a  node  at  the  t o p.  A  series  of  arrows  lead  from  the 
target  through  the  chapter,  a t t r i b u te  and  schema  layers 
to  the  subgoal  l a y e r.  Each  subgoal  consists  of  one  or 
more  conjoined  compounds  —  implying  that  they  a ll 
enter  the  reaction  to  generate  the  target  molecule. 
Thus,  the  compound  layer  is  an  AND-layer  in  t h is  AND-OR 
graph. 

If  a ll  the  compounds  needed  for  any  one  subgoal  are 
available  commercially  we  would  consider  that  we  know  a 
plausible  single-step  synthesis 
molecule.  Any  compound  generated  as  subgoal  which  is 
not  commercially  available  needs  to  be  synthesized  and 
can  be  considered  in  turn  as  a  target  molecule.

P a r t i al  Path  Evaluation  in  Chemical  Synthesis 

The  predominant  strategy  that  the  program  uses  is 
to  evaluate  every  path  in  the  search  tree  leading  down 
from  the  prime  target  molecule  and  to  choose  one  that 
gets  the  highest  value.  The  compounds  that  terminate 
the  branched  path  and  the  reactions  used  in  every  step 
enter  i n to  computing  the  value  f or  each  path.  The 
program  has  rules  on  computing  compound  merits, 
combining  merits  of  conjoined  compounds  to  get  subgoal 
merits  and  combining  those  with  reaction  merits  to 
obtain  values  that  can  be  backed  up  the  t r e e.

The  selection  of  subgoal  proceeds  from  the  top  of

Further,  a  contextual  reordering  is  possible  here. 

Vitamin  A,

in  a  smaller  but  similar  compound  w i th  only  three

When  continuing  search  v i th  t h is  new  subgoal  a  clear

prefer  to  operate  on  another  OLEFIN  BOND.  The 
s i m i l a r i ty  of  the  r e s u l t i ng  compound  also  raises  the 
expectation  that  successive  application  of  the  same 
transformation  may  solve  the  problem  at  hand. 

Key  Intermediate  Compounds  in  Chemical  Synthesis

Some  compounds  can  be  changed  quickly  i n to  a 

v a r i e ty  of  s i m i l ar  but  d i f f e r e nt  compounds  and  are 
often  used  as  key  intermediate  compounds  in  synthesis. 
When  a  subgoal  compound  is  similar  to  a  readily 
available  key  intermediate,  synthesis  search  may 
p r o f i t a b ly  be  geared  toward  the  specific  intermediate.

Use  of  Analogy  in  Chemical  Synthesis 

[suggested] 

Quite  often  chemists  a r r i ve  at  syntheses  by 

f o l l o w i ng  the  known  synthesis  of  an  analogous  compound. 
Situations  where  solution  (or  s i m p l i f i c a t i o n)  by 
analogy  can  be  applied  arise  profusely: 
the  goal 
compound  is  analogous  to  a  compound  whose  synthesis  is 
published,  a  key  intermediate  can  be  synthesized  by 
analogy  to  an  available  key  intermediate,  a  subgoal 
generated  is  similar  to  one  or  more  intermediate 
compounds  generated  and  solved  by  the  program  during 
t h is  run  alone.  However,  the  advantages  of  overruling 
normal  search  by  reasoning  through  analogy  in  these 
situations 

is  not  clear.

External  Conditions  Guiding  the  Search 

There  is  need  for  tempering  the  selection  of 

syntheses  with  such  considerations  as  the  t o x i c i ty  of 
the  substances  to  be  manipulated,  special  apparatus 
needed  to  contain  and  react  gases  and  cost  associated 
with  expensive  commercial  compounds,  reagents  or
