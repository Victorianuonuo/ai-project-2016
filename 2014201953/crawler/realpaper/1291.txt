Acoustic  Processing 

The  speech  data  currently  used  in  the  SRI  system 
are  obtained  in  a  quiet  room  using  a BX-K 433  condenser 
microphone  and  an  Ampex  AG  500  tape  recorder.  An  ana(cid:173)
log  tape  is  produced  at  7-1/2  inches  per  second  record(cid:173)
ing  speed.  The  speech  data  on  the  tape  arc  then  d i g i(cid:173)
tized  in  segments  of  up  to  3.1  seconds  in  length.  A 
presampling  low-pass  f i l t er  with  an  8-kHz  bandwidth 
is  employed  to  reduce  aliasing  e r r o r s,  and  the  d i g i(cid:173)
t i z a t i on  is  accomplished  by  a  12-bit  A/D  converter 
operating  at  a  rate  of  20,000  samples  per  second. 

The  raw  d i g i t al  data  are  processed  further  by 

f i l t e r i n g.  Five  rms  values  (root-mean-square, 

d i g i t al 
an  energy  measure)  of  the  time  series  data  are  calcu(cid:173)

f i r st  provides  an  amplitude  value  for 
the  u n f i l t e r ed 
time  series.  The  other  four  values  are  from  d i g i t a l' 
f i l t e rs  with  bandpass  characteristics  of  80-200  Hz, 
300-1000  Hz,  500-2800  Hz,  and  3.2-6.8  kHz.  A  linear

Word  V e r i f i c a t i on 

Procedures  for  word  v e r i f i c a t i on  relate  the  words 
predicted  by  syntactic  and  semantic  processing  to  the 
acoustic  data.  The  input  to  the  word  v e r i f i er  from 
p i n t le  was  a  set  of  words  that  could  be  expected  to 
occupy  the  next  position  in  the  utterance.  The  result 
of  word  v e r i f i c a t i on  is  a  subset,  possibly  empty,  of 
the  candidate  words  ordered  according  to  degree  of 
agreement  with  the  acoustic  data  at 
the  utterance.

It  should  be  clear  that  a  word  v e r i f i c a t i on  pro(cid:173)
cedure  of  t h is  kind  was  designed  for  use  in  a  system 
with  powerful  syntactic  and  semantic  constraints. 
In 
the  analysis  of  the  second  noun  group  in  the  sample 
sentence,  before  BOX  was  confirmed,  a  set  of  adjectives 
was  processed  by  the  word  v e r i f i e r.  A ll  of  the  words 
were  rejected  except  BLACK, 
for  which  the  confidence 
level  was  u n l i k e l y.  P i n t le  accepted  BLACK  t e n t a t i v e l y, 
but  that  would  have  had  to  be  the  end  of  the  sentence, 
and  PUT  THE  BLACK  BLOCK  IN  THE  BLACK  is  s y n t a c t i c a l ly 
and  semantically  unacceptable  in  the  current  system. 
Consequently,  P i n t le  backtracked  and  looked  f or  nouns. 
Of  the  set  predicted,  BOX  was  confirmed  w i th  the  high(cid:173)

If  BLOCKS  had  been  a  member  of 
that  set, 
the  word  v e r i f i er  might  have  returned  p o s i t i ve 
as  w e l l.  However,  since  things  cannot  be  put  in  blocks, 
that  word  would  be  excluded,  on  semantic  groundB,

Furthermore,  we  believe  that  the  motivation  for  changes

DISCUSSION 

The  major  focus  in  t h is  paper  has  been  on  the 

role  of  syntactic  and  semantic  analysis  in  our  speech 
understanding  system--and  appropriately  so  for  pre-
sentation  at  a  conference  on  a r t i f i c i al 
i n t e l l i g e n c e. 
But  in  describing  the  f i r st  version  of  the  system,  we 
have  emphasized  the  inadequacies  of  that  implementation 
and  the  requirements  we  see  as  necessary  in  succeeding 
versions.  Probably  the  major  result  of  t h is  early  work 
is  the  design  of  a  parser  that  we  believe  can  accommo(cid:173)

Conference.  Such  a  parser  would  be  well  suited  to
