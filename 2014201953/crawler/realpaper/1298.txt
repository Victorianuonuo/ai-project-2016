mechanism  to  be  discussed  s h o r t l y, 
the  system  finds 
the  SWG  node  *JOHN*  which  represents  the  p a r t i c u l ar 
John  under  discussion  and  creates  nodes  *BAKERY*, 
*CAKE*  and  *BAKER*  to  represent  the  bakery, 
the  cake 
and  the  baker.  Relationships  integrating  these  new

An  attempt  is  made  to  match  t h is  relationship  against 
those  encoded  in  the  SWG.  The  asterisk  is  allowed  to 
match  anything,  but  " s e l l e r" 
Thus  a  matching  r e l a t i on  must  be  of  the  form 
(AT  *BAKER*  - - ).  Since  no  auch  r e l a t i on  exists  in 
the  SWG,  no  action  is  taken.  The  next  relationship

the  baker  are  at  the  bakery  and  the  baker  owns  the

Processing 

interrogative  sentences 

The  processing  of  Interrogative  sentences  closely 

that  of  declarative  sentences  so  far  as 

p a r a l l e ls 
the 
determination  of  parameters  is  concerned.  Of  course, 
rather  than  direct  the  system  to  change  the  SWG  and 
extend  the  time  l i n e,  questions  cause  the  SWG  and  time 
l i ne  to  be  examined.  There  are  three  basic  types  of 
questions  the  system  can  answer. 

An  example  of  the  f i r st  type  is  "What  man  bought 

is  conducted  u n t il  an  event 

a  cake  at  the  bakery?"  Questions  of  t h is  type  are 
answered  by  examination  of  the  time  l i n e.  For  the 
current  example,  a  search  down  the  time  l i ne  (toward 
the  past) 
is  found  whose 
event  class  is  EXCHANGE  and  whose  LOC  parameter  has 
the  value  *BAKERY*.  When  such  a  node  is  found  a  test 
Is  made  to  see  if  the  value  of  the  THINGBT  parameter

another  test

passed  then  the  value  of  BUYER  is  the  answer  to  the 
question.  Either  the  value  of  BUYER  (a  noun  e n t i ty 
node)  or  the  parent  event  node  may  be  passed  to  the 
response  generator.  The  generator,  as  w i ll  be  seen 
s h o r t l y,  produces  either  a  noun  phrase  or  a  complete 
sentence  answer,  respectively.
