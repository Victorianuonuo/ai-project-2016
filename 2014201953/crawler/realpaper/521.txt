Abstract 

Coalition formation is a key problem in automated 
negotiation among self-interested agents, and other 
multiagent  applications.  A  coalition  of agents  can 
sometimes  accomplish  things  that  the  individual 
agents  cannot,  or  can  do  things  more  efficiently. 
However,  motivating  the  agents  to  abide  to  a  so(cid:173)
lution  requires  careful  analysis:  only  some  of the 
solutions  are  stable  in  the  sense  that  no  group  of 
agents  is  motivated  to  break  off and  form  a  new 
coalition.  This  constraint  has  been  studied  ex(cid:173)
tensively  in  cooperative  game  theory.  However, 
the computational questions around this constraint 
have  received  less  attention.  When  it  comes  to 
coalition  formation  among  software  agents  (that 
represent  real-world  parties),  these  questions  be(cid:173)
come  increasingly explicit. 
In this paper we define a concise general represen(cid:173)
tation  for  games  in  characteristic  form  that  relies 
on  superadditivity,  and  show  that  it  allows  for  ef(cid:173)
ficient  checking  of whether  a  given  outcome  is  in 
the core.  We then  show  that  determining  whether 
the  core  is  nonempty  is 
-complete  both  with 
and  without  transferable  utility.  We  demonstrate 
that  what makes the problem hard in both cases  is 
determining  the  collaborative  possibilities  (the  set 
of outcomes  possible  for  the  grand  coalition),  by 
showing  that  if  these  are  given,  the  problem  be(cid:173)
comes  tractable  in  both cases.  However,  we  then 
demonstrate  that  for a  hybrid  version  of the  prob(cid:173)
lem,  where  utility  transfer  is  possible  only  within 
the  grand  coalition,  the  problem  remains  , 
complete even  when  the  collaborative possibilities 
are given. 

Introduction 

1 
Coalition  formation  is  a  key  problem  in  automated negotia(cid:173)
tion  among  self-interested agents.  A  coalition  of agents can

, and  

sometimes accomplish things that the individual  agents can(cid:173)
not,  or  can  do  things  more  efficiently.  However,  motivat(cid:173)
ing  the  agents  to  abide  to  a solution  requires  careful  analy(cid:173)
sis:  only  some  of the  solutions  are  stable  in  the  sense  that 
no group of agents is motivated to break off and form a new 
coalition.  This constraint has been studied extensively in co-
operative game theory.  However, the computational questions 
around  this  constraint  have  received  less  attention.  When 
it comes  to coalition  formation  among  software  agents  (that 
represent real-world parties), these questions become increas(cid:173)
ingly  explicit. 

In  general,  computational  complexity  could  stem  from 
each potential coalition having some hard optimization prob(cid:173)
lem.  For  example,  when  the  agents  are  carrier  companies 
with their own trucks and delivery tasks, they can save costs 
by  forming  a  coalition  (pooling  their trucks  and  tasks),  but 
each  potential  coalition  faces  a  hard  optimization  problem: 
a  vehicle  routing  problem  defined  by  the  coalition's  trucks 
and  tasks.  The  effect  of  such  hard  optimization  problems 
on  coalition  formation  has  been  studied  by  Sandholm  and 
Lesser  [Sandholm  and  Lesser,  1997].  As  in  the  bulk of re(cid:173)
search on coalition formation, in this paper we do not address 
that  issue.  Rather,  we  assume  that  such  optimization  prob(cid:173)
lems  have  already  been  solved  (at  least  the  pertinent  ones), 
and given this, we characterize the stable feasible outcomes. 
This has been the focus of most of the work  in coalition for(cid:173)
mation.  The  contribution  of this  paper belongs  to  the  rela(cid:173)
tively  new,  small  set  of papers  that  study  the  complexity  of 
characterizing such solutions. 

The determination  of stable  solutions  has  electronic  com(cid:173)
merce  applications  beyond  automated  negotiation  as  well. 
For  example,  consider  a  large  number  of companies,  some 
subsets  of which  could  form profitable  virtual  organizations 
that can respond to larger or more diverse orders than the in(cid:173)
dividual companies can.  Determining stable  value divisions 
allows one to see which potential virtual organizations would 
be viable in the sense that the companies in the virtual orga(cid:173)
nization  would naturally  stay together.  As  another example, 
consider  a  future  online  service  that  determines  how  much 
each employee of a company should be paid so that the com(cid:173)
pany does not collapse as a result of employees being bought 
away  by  other companies.  The  input  to  this  service  would 
be how much subsets of the company's employees would be 
paid if they left collectively (for instance, a whole department

could  be bought  away).  This  input could come  from salary 
databases or a manager's estimate.  The computational prob(cid:173)
lem  of determining  a  stable  renumeration  would  be  crucial 
for  such  a  service.  Both  of these  example  problems  fit  ex(cid:173)
actly under the model  that we study in this paper. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  In Section 2, 
we review the required concepts from cooperative game the(cid:173)
ory.  In Section 3, we define a concise general representation 
for games  in  characteristic  form  that  relies  on  superadditiv(cid:173)
ity,  and  show  that  it allows  for efficient checking of whether 
a given outcome  is  in  the core.  In  Section 4,  we  show that 
determining  whether the  core  is  nonempty is 
-complete 
both  with  and  without transferable  utility.  In  Section  5,  we 
demonstrate that what makes the problem hard in both cases 
is  determining  the  collaborative  possibilities  (the  set of out(cid:173)
comes  possible  for  the  grand  coalition),  by  showing  that  if 
these are given, the problem becomes tractable in both cases. 
In  Section  6,  we show that  for a hybrid version of the prob(cid:173)
lem,  where  utility  transfer is  possible  only  within  the  grand 
coalition, the problem remains 
-complete even when the 
collaborative possibilities are given. 

2  Definitions from cooperative game theory 
In  this section we review standard definitions  from coopera(cid:173)
tive game theory, which we will use throughout the paper.  In 
the  definitions,  we  follow  the  most prevalent  advanced  text-
book in microeconomics iMas-Colell et  al.,  1995]. 

In general,  how well agents in a coalition do may depend 
on  what nonmembers  of the coalition  do (e.g.  LBernheim et 
Â«/.,  1987; Chatterjee et ai,  1993; Evans,  1997; Milgrom and 
Roberts,  1996;  Moreno  and  Wooders,  1996;  Okada,  1996; 
Ray,  1996]).  However,  in  cooperative  game  theory,  coali(cid:173)
tion  formation  is  usually  studied  in  the  context  of  charac(cid:173)
teristic function  games  where  the  utilities  of  the  coalition 
members  do  not  depend  on  the  nonmembers1  actions  LKa-
han and Rapoport,  1984; van der Linden and Verbeek,  1985: 
Zlotkin and Rosenschein, 1994; Charnes and Kortanek, 1966; 
Shapley,  1967;  Wu,  1977].  (One  way  to  interpret this  is  to 
consider  the  coalition  members'  utilities  to  be  the  utilities 
they can guarantee themselves no matter what the nonmem(cid:173)
bers do LAumann, 1959; Tohme and Sandholm, 1999].) 
Definition 1  Given  a  set  of players  A,  a  utility  possibil(cid:173)
ity  vector 
is  a  vector 
representing  utilities  that  the  players  in  B 
can guarantee themselves by cooperating with each other.  A 
utility  possibility  set  is a  set  of utility possibility  vectors for a 
given set B. 
Definition 2 A game in characteristic form consists of a set of 
players  A  and a  utility possibility set 

for each  

Sometimes games in characteristic form have transferable 
utility,  which  means  agents in  a coalition  can  transfer utility 
among themselves. 
Definition 3  A  game  in  characteristic form  is  said  to  have 
transferable utility if for every

there is a number  

It  is commonly  assumed  that  the joining of two coalitions 
does not prevent them from acting as well as they could have 
acted separately.  In other words, the composite coalition can 
coordinate  by  choosing  not  to  coordinate.  This  assumption 
is  known  as  superadditivity}  We  will  assume  superadditiv-
ity  throughout  the  paper.  This  actually  makes  our  hardness 
results stronger because even a restricted version of the prob(cid:173)
lem is hard.

We now need a solution concept.  In this paper,  we study 
only  the  best  known  solution  concept,  which  is  called  the 
core  [Mas-Colell  et  al,  1995;  Kahan  and  Rapoport,  1984; 
van der Linden and Verbeek,  1985]. It was first introduced by 
Gillies [Gillies, 19531.

An outcome is in the core if it is blocked by no coali(cid:173)

tion. 

In general, the core can be empty.  If the core is empty, the 
game is inherently unstable because no matter what outcome 
is chosen, some subset of agents is motivated to pull out and 
form  their own  coalition.  In  other  words,  requiring  that  no 
subset of agents  is  motivated to break off into  a coalition  of 
its own overconstrains the system. 

players 

An example of a game with an empty core is the one with 
, where we have the utility possibility vectors 
(and the 
ones  that can  be derived  from  this  through  superadditivity). 
The same example with transferable utility also has an empty 
core. 

, and 

In the rest of this paper, we will study the question of how 
complex it is to determine whether the core is nonempty, that 
is,  whether  there  is  a  solution  or  the  problem  is  overcon-
strained. 

3  Representing characteristic form games 

concisely 

In our representation of games in characteristic form, we dis(cid:173)
tinguish  between  games  without  transferable  utility,  where 
we  specify  some  utility  possibility  vectors  for  some  coali(cid:173)
tions,  and games with transferable utility,  where we specify 
the values of some coalitions. 

'When  superadditivity  holds,  it  is  always  best  for  the  grand 
coalition  of all  agents  to  form.  On  the  other hand,  without  su(cid:173)
peradditivity,  even  finding  the  optimal  coalition  structure  (parti(cid:173)
tion of agents into coalitions) can be hard [Sandholm et al.,  1999; 
Larson  and  Sandholm,  2000;  Shehory  and  Kraus,  1998;  1996; 
Ketchpel, 1994].

MULTIAGENT  SYSTEMS 

If the representation  of the game specifies 

explicitly for each coalition 
then the length of the 
representation is exponential in the number of agents.  In that 
case, any algorithm for evaluating nonemptiness of the core 
(as long as it reads all the input) requires time exponential in 
the number of agents. However, that run time is polynomial in 
the size of the input (this can be accomplished, for example, 
using the algorithms that we introduce in Section 5). 

Of course,  most characteristic  form  games  that represent 
real-world settings have some special structure. This usually 
allows  for  a  game  representation  that  is  significantly  more 
concise.  The complexity  of characterizing  the core  has  alÂ­
ready been studied in certain very specific concisely expressÂ­
ible families of games before. For example, Faigle et al. study 
the  complexity  of testing  membership  in  the  core  in  miniÂ­
mum  cost spanning  tree  games  [Faigle et al,  1994].  Deng 
and Papadimitriou study games where the players are nodes 
of a graph with weights on the edges, and the value of a coaliÂ­
tion is determined by the total weight of the edges contained 
in it [Deng and Papadimitriou, 1994J. Deng et al. study an inÂ­
teger programming formulation which captures many games 
on  graphs  [Deng  et ai,  1997].  All  of those  results  depend 
heavily on  concise game  representations  which  are specific 
to the game  families under study.  Typically,  such a family 
of games is played on a combinatorial structure. Cooperative 
games on combinatorial structures have been systematically 
studied [Bilbao, 2000]. 

As a point of deviation, we study a natural representation 
that can capture any characteristic form game.2  Conciseness 
in our representation  stems only from the fact that  in many 
settings,  the  synergies  among coalitions  are  sparse.  When 
a coalition  introduces no new  synergy,  its utility possibility 
vectors can be derived using superadditivity.  Therefore, the 
input needs  to include only  the utility  possibility  vectors  of 
coalitions  that  introduce  synergy.  The following definitions 
make this precise. 
Definition 6  We  represent  a  game  in  characteristic form 
without  transferable  utility  by  a  set  of players  A,  and a 
set of utility possibility vectors 
(Here 
there may be multiple vectors for the same B, distinguished 
by  different  k  indices.)  The  utility  possibility  set  for  a 
given 

is then given by

does not receive a value 

So, we only need to specify a basis of utility possibilities, 
from which we can then derive the others.  This representaÂ­
tion integrates rather nicely with real-world problems where 
determining any coalition's value is complex. For example, in 
the multiagent vehicle routing problem, we solve the routing 
problem for every coalition that might introduce new synerÂ­
gies.  When it is clear that there is no synergy between two 
coalitions (for example, if they operate in different cities and 
each one only has deliveries within its city), there is no need 
to solve the routing problem of the coalition that would result 
if the two coalitions were to merge. 

The following  lemmas indicate that  we can  also use this 
representation  effectively  for checking  whether an  outcome 
is in the core,  that is,  whether it satisfies the strategic conÂ­
straints. 
Lemma 1  Without transferable utility,  an outcome uA  â 
is blocked by some coalition if and 
only if it is blocked by some coalition B through some utility 
vector uB, where

4  Checking whether the core is nonempty is 

hard 

We now show that with this representation, it is hard to check 
whether the core is nonempty.  This holds both for the nonÂ­
transferable utility setting and for the transferable utility setÂ­
ting. 
Definition 8 (CORE-NONEMPTY)  We are given a super-
additive game in characteristic form (with or without trans(cid:173)
ferable utility) in our representation language. We are asked 
whether the core is nonempty. 

We will demonstrate AfP-hardness of this problem by reÂ­
ducing from the AfP-completc EXACT-COVER-BY-3-SETS 
problem [Garey and Johnson,

sults for specific game families because it is not possible to concisely 
represent those games in our input language. 

3Setting the utility to 0 in this case is without loss of generality, 

as we can simply normalize the utility function to obtain this.

a set S of size 'Sm and a collection of subsets

We might  hope  that  the  convexity  introduced by transferÂ­
able utility makes the problem tractable through, for example, 
linear programming. This turns out not to be the case. 
Theorem  2  CORE-NONEMPTY  with  transferable  utility  is 
MV-complete. 

Proof:  To show that the problem  is  in MV,  nondeterministi-
cally  choose  a  subset  of W9  and  check  if the  corresponding 
coalitions  constitute  a partition  of A.  If so,  nondeterministi-

is  possible. 

Now suppose  there  is no exact cover by 3-sets.  Then  the 
coalition S has value less than 3 771 (since there are no m disÂ­
joint Sx), and as a result the value of the grand coalition is less 
than 9m.  It follows that in any outcome, the total utility of at 
least one  of 
is less than Gra. So 
this coalition will block.  So the core is empty. 

and 

Our results  imply  that  it  is  computationally  hard  to  make 
any  strategic  assessment  of  a  game  in  characteristic  form 
when it is concisely represented.

grand coalition makes the problem 
tractable 

Our proofs  that CORE-NONEMPTY  is  hard  relied  on  conÂ­
structing instances where it is difficult to determine what the 
grand  coalition  can  accomplish.  So,  in  effect,  the  hardness 
derived  from the  fact that  even  collaborative optimization  is 
hard in these instances.  While this is indeed a real difficulty 
that  occurs  in  the  analysis  of characteristic  form  games,  we 
may nevertheless wonder to what extent computational comÂ­
plexity issues are introduced by the purely strategic aspect of 
the games.  To analyze this, we investigate the computational 
complexity  of  CORE-NONEMPTY  when  V(A)  (or  v(A)) 
is explicitly  provided  as  (possibly  redundant)  input,  so  that 
determining what the grand coalition can accomplish can no 
longer be the source of any complexity.4  It indeed  turns out 
that the problem becomes easy both with and  without transÂ­
ferable utility.

teristic form games with transferable utility when there is an oracle 
that can provide the value v(B) of any coalition B [Bilbao et al.% ]. 
Our amended input corresponds to asking one such query in addition 
to obtaining the unamended input. 

MULTIAGENT  SYSTEMS 

Proof:  We decide how to allocate the v(A) among the agents 
by solving a linear program. The core is nonempty if and only 
if the following linear program has a solution:

The algorithms in the proofs also construct a solution that 

is in the core, if the core is nonempty. 

6  Hybrid games remain hard 
Not all complexity issues disappear through having the colÂ­
laborative  optimization  problem  solution  available.  It  turns 
out that if we allow for hybrid games, where only some coaliÂ­
tions can transfer utility among themselves, the hardness reÂ­
turns. In particular, we show hardness in the case where only 
the grand coalition can transfer utility. This is a natural model 
for example in settings where there is a market institution that 
enforces payments, but if a subset of the agents breaks off, the 
institution collapses so payments cannot be enforced. 

We demonstrate AfP-hardness of this problem by reducing 
from the AAP-complete NODE-COVER problem iGarey and 
Johnson, 19791. 
Definition 10 (NODE-COVER)  We are given a graph G = 
(V, E),  and a number k.  We are asked whether there is a 
subset ofV of size k such that each edge has at least one of 
its endpoints in the subset. 

We are now ready to state our result.

We claim the two instances are equivalent. 

First suppose there is a node cover of size k.  Consider the 
following outcome:  all the vertices in the node cover receive 
utility  1,  all the other vertices receive utility 0,  and each of 
x,  y,  and  z  receives  utility 
Using the fact that all the

Now, for each edge 
, at least one of its vertices must 
receive utility at least 1, or this edge would block. So the verÂ­
tices that receive at least 1 cover the edges.  But because the 
combined utility of all the elements of V is at most A:, there 
can be at most k such vertices. So there is a node cover.

Hybrid  games,  where  only  some  coalitions  can  transfer 
utility,  are  quite  likely  to  appear  in  real-world  multiagent 
settings,  for example  because  only  some  of the  agents  use 
a  currency.  Our  result  shows  that  for  such  hybrid  games, 
even  when  the  collaborative  optimization  problem  has  alÂ­
ready been solved,  it can be computationally hard to strateÂ­
gically assess the game. 

7  Conclusions and future research 
Coalition formation is a key problem in automated negotiaÂ­
tion among self-interested agents,  and other multiagent apÂ­
plications.  A coalition of agents can  sometimes accomplish 
things that the individual agents cannot, or can do things more 
efficiently.  However, motivating the agents to abide to a soÂ­
lution  requires careful  analysis:  only  some of the solutions 
are stable in the sense that no group of agents is motivated 
to break  off and  form  a  new  coalition.  This  constraint has 
been studied extensively in cooperative game theory.  HowÂ­
ever, the computational questions around this constraint have 
received  less  attention.  When  it comes  to coalition  formaÂ­
tion  among  software  agents  (that  represent  real-world  parÂ­
ties), these questions become increasingly explicit. 

In this paper we defined a concise general  representation 
for games in characteristic form that relies on superadditivity, 
and  showed  that  it  allows  for efficient  checking  of whether 
a given outcome is in the core.  We then showed that deterÂ­
mining whether the core is nonempty is  NP-complete  both 
with  and without  transferable utility.  We demonstrated that 
what  makes  the problem  hard  in  both cases  is  determining 
the  collaborative  possibilities  (the  set  of outcomes  possible 
for the grand coalition), by showing that if these are given, the 
problem becomes tractable in both cases.  However, we then 
demonstrated that for a hybrid version of the problem, where 
utility transfer is possible only within the grand coalition, the 
problem remains A/'P-complete even when the collaborative 
possibilities are given. 

Future research can take a number of different directions. 
One  such  direction  is  to  investigate  the  complexity  of reÂ­
stricted  families  of games  in  characteristic  form.5  Another 
direction is to evaluate other solution concepts in cooperative 
game theory from the perspective of computational complexÂ­
ity  under  our  input  representation.  A  long-term  goal  is  to 
extend our framework for finding a strategically stable soluÂ­
tion to take into account issues of computational complexity 

5One interesting restricted family is that of convex games. In a 

convex game (with transferable utility), for any  

and in such games the core is 
known to always be nonempty. How complex it is here to construct 
a solution in the core with our representation is an open question.
