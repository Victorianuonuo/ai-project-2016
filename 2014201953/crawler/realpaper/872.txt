Abstract

Based on the study of a generalized form of rep-
resenter theorem and a speciﬁc trick in construct-
ing kernels, a generic learning model is proposed
and applied to support vector machines. An algo-
rithm is obtained which naturally generalizes the
bias term of SVM. Unlike the solution of standard
SVM which consists of a linear expansion of ker-
nel functions and a bias term, the generalized algo-
rithm maps predeﬁned features onto a Hilbert space
as well and takes them into special consideration by
leaving part of the space unregularized when seek-
ing a solution in the space. Empirical evaluations
have conﬁrmed the effectiveness from the general-
ization in classiﬁcation tasks.

1 Introduction

Support vector machines (SVM) have been shown to per-
form well in many machine learning applications. Based
on Vapnik’s seminal work in statistical learning theory[Vap-
nik, 1998], the algorithm starts with the ideas of separating
hyperplanes and margins. Given the data (xi; yi)m
i=1 where
xi ∈ Rd
and yi ∈ {+1, −1}, one searches for the lin-
ear hyperplane that separates the positive and negative sam-
ples with the largest margin (the distance from the hyper-
plane to the nearest data point).
In the nonseparable case,
a soft margin method is used to choose a hyperplane that
splits the examples as cleanly as possible. Using a kernel
Kx (x(cid:2)) = K (x, x(cid:2)) (a positive deﬁnite function) to extend
the algorithm to the nonlinear case, an optimal hyperplane is
found which has a simple representation as a linear expansion
of kernel functions and a constant

m(cid:2)

∗ =

f

ciKxi

+ b

(1)

i=1

where each ci is a real number and b is called a bias term.

In the case of nonseparability, some meanings of the mar-
gin motivation are lost. [Girosi, 1998; Evgeniou et al., 2000;
Poggio and Smale, 2003] suggest a different view of SVM
based on a framework championed by Poggio and other
researchers[Poggio and Girosi, 1990a; 1990b] which implic-
itly treats learning as an approximation problem and tries to

ﬁnd a solution to a regularized minimization problem

in HK for some γ > 0. This expression represents a tradeoff
between the empirical error as calculated by the loss func-
tion V , and ”smoothness” of the solution as represented by
the norm of f in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)
HK which is induced by a kernel K. γ (cid:3)f (cid:3)2
K is also called
a regularizer. SVM can be partially derived from this frame-
work with the choice of a hinge loss function V (y, f (x)) ≡
max (1 − yf (x) , 0). The only incompatibility comes from
the bias term b, which makes the combined model (1) gener-
ally not in HK any more.

In this paper, we follow the regularization point of view.
Based on the study of a generalized regularizer which leaves
part of the hypothesis space unregularized and a speciﬁc trick
in constructing kernels, we propose a new learning scheme
which allows user to predeﬁne features, and uses these fea-
tures and kernel expansions to derive a solution in the hy-
pothesis space, instead of considering kernel expansions only
as in existing kernel-based methods. When the idea is applied
to SVM, we obtain an algorithm which naturally generalizes
the bias term of SVM. The generalized term linearly com-
bines the predeﬁned features instead of being a constant only.
Different from the empirical results that the existence of the
bias term does not make much signiﬁcance in practice[Rifkin,
2002], we will show the term is not trivial any more when it is
generalized, and appropriate choices of the term will improve
the applicability of the algorithm.

The paper is organized as follows.

In section 2, we in-
vestigate a generalized regularizer in the regularized learning
framework and study its associated solution when it is applied
to SVM. In section 3, after introducing a kernel construc-
tion trick, with which predeﬁned features are mapped onto an
RKHS, we further clarify the mathematical details in deriv-
ing SVM. A new algorithm is proposed in section 4 based on
the previous discussions. Empirical results are demonstrated
in section 5. Finally, section 6 presents our discussions and
conclusions.

Suppose HK is the direct sum of two subspaces: HK = H0⊕

corresponding to the empirical error at point xi, our problem
becomes

We want to minimize L with respect to f and ξi and maxi-
mize w.r.t. αi and ζi, subject to the constraints of the primal
problem and nonnegativity constraints on αi and ζi. Taking
derivative w.r.t. ξi and setting it to zero, we have

Substituting (5) into (4), we have

The derived minimizer in (7) satisﬁes the reproduction
property. Suppose (xi; yi)m
i=1 comes from a model that is
perfectly linearly related to {ϕ1, · · · , ϕ(cid:2)}, it is desirable to
get back a solution independent of other features. As an ev-
ident result of (3), the property is satisﬁed. The parameters
c1, · · · , cm in (7) will all be zero, which makes the regularizer
in (3) equal to zero. As will be shown in the experiments, this
property often has the effect of stabilizing the results from dif-
ferent choices of kernels and regularization parameters prac-
tically.

3 Mapping Predeﬁned Features onto RKHS
By decomposing a hypothesis space HK and studying a gen-
eralized regularizer, we have proposed a generalized regular-
ized learning model and derived its associated solution which
consists of a linear expansion of kernel functions and prede-
ﬁned features. In this section, we will introduce a kernel con-
struction trick which maps kernel functions and predeﬁned
features simultaneously onto a Hilbert space. Then we will
show the mathematical details in deriving SVM with a gener-
alized bias term.

3.1 A Kernel Construction Trick
Given features {ϕ1, · · · , ϕ(cid:2)} and a strictly positive deﬁnite
function Φ, let us consider the following reproducing kernel

computations.

By property (12), we can see that predeﬁned features
{ϕ1, · · · , ϕ(cid:2)} are explicitly mapped onto HK , which has a
1, · · · , ϕ(cid:2)
subspace H0 = span (ϕ(cid:2)

(cid:2)} also forms an orthonormal basis

(12) and (14), the minimizer in (7) can be rewritten as:

The ﬁrst box constraint comes from (5) and the nonnegativ-
ity of α, requiring 0 ≤ αi ≤ 1
(1 ≤ i ≤ m). The second

equality constraint comes from (20). YT
2 HY2 is a strictly
positive deﬁnite matrix, and the problem becomes a standard
quadratic program(QP). Comparing with SVM’s QP[Vapnik,
1998], the new problem requires (cid:4) equality constraints in-
stead of one equality constraint. This seems to burden the
computations. Actually, because the major computations in
solving the QP come from the box constraint, these equality
constraints will not affect the computations much.

4 A Generalized Algorithm

4.1 Algorithm
Based on the discussions above, an algorithm which general-
izes the bias term of SVM is proposed as follows:

1. Start with data (xi; yi)m
2. For (cid:4) (≤ m) predeﬁned linearly independent features
(cid:2)} according

{ϕ1, · · · , ϕ(cid:2)} of the data, deﬁne {ϕ(cid:2)
to equation (10).

1, · · · , ϕ(cid:2)

i=1.

3. Choose a symmetric, strictly positive deﬁnite function
Φx (x(cid:2)) = Φ (x, x(cid:2)) which is continuous on Rd × Rd
.
Get Hx according to equation (9).

4. Deﬁne f : Rd → R by

(cid:2)(cid:2)

f (x) =

˜
λpϕ(cid:2)

p (x) +

m(cid:2)

˜ciHxi

(x) ,

(26)

p=1

i=(cid:2)+1

where the solution of ˜c(cid:2)+1, · · · , ˜cm comes
from
a quadratic program (23) and equation (22), and
˜
˜
λ1, · · · ,
λ(cid:2) is obtained by solving a linear program (25).

4.2 Virtual Samples

1, · · · , ϕ(cid:2)

The new algorithm needs the construction of an orthonormal
(cid:2)} from predeﬁned features {ϕ1, · · · , ϕ(cid:2)}
basis {ϕ(cid:2)
w.r.t. (cid:4) samples via a linear transformation. However, al-
gorithms, which search for linear hyperplanes to separate the
data, are often not invariant to linear transformations. To pro-
vide the invariance, we consider an alternative approach that
avoids the transformation.

We introduce (cid:4) virtual points xv1 , · · · , xv(cid:2) satisfying

(cid:6)

(cid:11)

(cid:12)

ϕp

xvq

=

1 ≤ p = q ≤ (cid:4)
1 ≤ p (cid:10)= q ≤ (cid:4)

.

The label yvq of each virtual point xvq is deﬁned to be 0. We
study the following problem:

1, · · · , ϕ(cid:2)

It can be easily seen that ϕ1, · · · , ϕ(cid:2) have formed an or-
thonormal basis of H0 w.r.t. the virtual points and there is no
need to compute ϕ(cid:2)
(cid:2) any more. The new regularized
minimization problem in (27) is equivalent to the original one
in (3) with a hinge loss. The introduction of the virtual points
does not change the scope of the classiﬁcation problem while
having avoided the linear transformation to construct an or-
thonormal basis.

Figure 1: Image classiﬁcation accuracies using coil20 dataset
with different number of training images. Twenty predeﬁned
features along with a Gaussian kernel Φ are used by SVM-
GB; Φ is also used by SVM. The kernel and regularization
parameters are selected via cross validation. One-versus-one
strategy is used for multi-classiﬁcation.

5 Experiments
To evaluate the effectiveness brought by the generalized bias
term, two groups of empirical results are reported. The ﬁrst
group of experiments focused on the reproduction property
of the generalized bias term. It used Columbia university im-
age library (coil-20) dataset1 for image classiﬁcation. The
dataset has 1, 440 images x1, · · · , x1440 evenly distributed in
20 classes. After preprocessing, each image was represented
as a 32 × 32 = 1024 dimensional vector with each compo-
nent having a value between 0 and 255 indicating the gray
level at each pixel. Four experiments were performed. Each
experiment used the ﬁrst 6, 12, 24 and 48 images respectively
within each class for training and the rest for testing.

Using recently developed nonlinear dimensionality reduc-
tion technqiues[Tenenbaum et al., 2000; Roweis and Saul,
2000], we found that these images actually form a manifold
with a much lower dimension than the original 1, 024 dimen-
sions. With the prior knowledge, twenty features ϕ1, · · · , ϕ20
were predeﬁned as follows:

(cid:6)

ϕp (xi) =

1
0

3N N (xi) ∩ trainp (cid:10)= {}

otherwise

where 1 ≤ p ≤ 20, 1 ≤ i ≤ 1440, 3N N (x) deﬁnes the three
nearest neighbors in geodesic distance to x, and trainp is the
set of training images with class label p. The geodesic dis-
tance was computed by the graph shortest path algorithm as
in [Tenenbaum et al., 2000]. Deﬁning features in this way, we
implicitly used a kN N classiﬁer as a generalized bias term.
Similar ideas can be generalized to combining different ap-
proaches other than kN N .

Figure 1 compares classiﬁcation accuracies among SVM,
kN N , and the new algorithm (denoted by SVM-GB). An in-
sightful study of the results may ﬁnd that the 20 predeﬁned
features have dominated the learned SVM-GB solution due to
the reproduction property, and made the performance of the
algorithm similar to kN N which shows better performance
than standard SVM on this dataset.

GB has better results than SVM in BoW representation in all
experiments, which gives us the belief that the embedding of
pLSA features improves the accuracy.

6 Discussion and Conclusion

The idea of regularized learning can be traced back to modern
regularization theory[Tikhonov and Arsenin, 1977; Morozov,
1984], which states that the existence of a regularizer helps to
provide a unique stable solution to ill-posed problems. In this
paper, we have considered the usage of a generalized regular-
izer in kernel-based learning. One straightforward reason that
part of the hypothesis space is left unregularized in the new
regularizer is due to a well-accepted fact that ﬁnite dimen-
sional problems are often well-posed[Bertero et al., 1988;
De Vito et al., 2005] and do not always need regularization,
as in the case of learning problems deﬁned in a subspace
spanned by a number of predeﬁned features. Similar idea
was explored in spline smoothing[Wahba, 1990] that leaves
polynomial features unregularized.
In kernel-based learn-
ing, the most similar to our work is the semiparametric SVM
model[Smola et al., 1998], which combines a set of unreg-
ularized basis functions with SVM. However, to our knowl-
edge, few algorithms and applications have been investigated
for machine learning tasks from a uniﬁed RKHS regulariza-
tion viewpoint in a general way.

With the new regularizer and a speciﬁc trick in construct-
ing kernels, predeﬁned features are explicitly mapped onto
a Hilbert space and taken into special consideration during
the learning, which differentiates our work from standard
kernel-based approaches that only consider kernel expansions
and a constant in learning. For projecting predeﬁned fea-
tures onto an RKHS, the idea of a conditionally positive def-
inite function[Micchelli, 1986] is lurking in the background,
which goes beyond the discussion of this paper.

When applying the idea to SVM, we have developed a new
algorithm which can be regarded as having generalized the
bias term of SVM. With domain speciﬁc knowledge in pre-
deﬁning features, this generalization makes the bias term not
trivial any more. As conﬁrmed by the experimental results,
correct choices of features help to improve the accuracy and
make the algorithm more stable in terms of sensitivity to the
selection of kernels and regularization parameters.

The reproduction property also helps to lessen the sensitiv-
ity of the algorithm to the choices of kernels and the regular-
ization parameter γ. To illustrate the effect, another experi-
ment was conducted using 48×20 training images. Instead of
using cross validation for parameter selection, four groups of
kernel and regularization parameters were ﬁxed. Figure 2 de-
picts the results. The generalized bias term makes SVM-GB
more stable to the variations of kernel and regularization pa-
rameters. This property is especially useful concerning the
practical situations where arbitrariness exists in designing
kernels for some applications.

To further study the performance of the new algorithm, the
second group of experiments was conducted on text catego-
rization tasks using 20-newsgroups dataset2. The dataset col-
lects UseNet postings into twenty newsgroups and each group
has about 1, 000 messages. We experimented with its four
major subsets. The ﬁrst subset has ﬁve groups (comp.*), the
second four groups (rec.*), the third four groups (sci.*) and
the last four groups (talk.*).

For the dataset, we removed all but the 2, 000 words with
highest mutual information with the class variable by rain-
bow package[McCallum, 1996]. Each document was repre-
sented by bag-of-words (BoW) which treats individual words
as features. A linear kernel coupled with 10 predeﬁned fea-
tures ϕ1, · · · , ϕ10, which were obtained by probabilistic la-
tent semantic analysis (pLSA) [Hofmann, 1999], was used as
input for SVM-GB. Experiments were carried out with dif-
ferent number (100˜3, 200) of training documents for each
subset. One experiment consisted of ten runs and the average
accuracy was reported. In each run, the data were separated
by the xval-prep utility accompanied in C4.5 package3.

As a comparison, SVM was tested with a linear kernel,
which is a commonly used method for text categorizations.
For completeness, both BoW and pLSA representations of
documents were experimented. As can been seen in ﬁgure 3,
although SVM with pLSA representation performs well when
the number of training samples is small, the approach loses
its advantage when the training set increases to a moderate
size. SVM-GB reports the best performance when we have
800 training documents or more. It is also shown that SVM-
