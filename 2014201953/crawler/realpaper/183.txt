Abstract

We analyze the asymptotic conditional validity of
modal formulas, i.e., the probability that a formula
ψ is valid in the ﬁnite Kripke structures in which
a given modal formula ϕ is valid, when the size
of these Kripke structures grows to inﬁnity. We
characterize the formulas ψ that are almost surely
valid (i.e., with probability 1) in case ϕ is a ﬂat, S5-
consistent formula, and show that these formulas ψ
are exactly those which follow from ϕ according
to the nonmonotonic modal logic S5G. Our results
provide – for the ﬁrst time – a probabilistic seman-
tics to a well-known nonmonotonic modal logic,
establishing a new bridge between nonmonotonic
and probabilistic reasoning, and give a computa-
tional account of the asymptotic conditional valid-
ity problem in Kripke structures.

Introduction

Asymptotic Probabilities in Modal Logic. Asymptotic (or
limit) probabilities of classical logic formulas have been in-
vestigated in various contexts [Glebskii et al., 1969; Fa-
gin, 1976; Compton, 1988; Kolaitis and Vardi, 1990; Le
Bars, 1998]. Halpern and Kapron have analyzed asymp-
totic probability in modal logic [Halpern and Kapron, 1994],
where, instead of relational structures, Kripke structures are
considered, and where the size of a structure is measured
in terms of the number of its worlds. Among various re-
sults, 1 they have shown that every modal formula is ei-
ther almost surely true or almost surely false in ﬁnite Kripke
structures. Thus, there is a 0-1 law for modal logic K,
analogous to the 0-1 law for function-free ﬁrst-order logic
[Fagin, 1976; Glebskii et al., 1969].
To give a simple example, if p is a propositional letter
of a considered ﬁnite alphabet A, then the modal formula2
M p is almost surely true (w.r.t. modal logic K). In fact, it
can be seen that if n → ∞, then the cardinality of the set
An of Kripke structures for A of size ≤ n satisfying M p
(i.e., where at least one world satisfying p is reachable from

corrected in [Le Bars, 2002], but those referred-to in the present
paper are perfectly correct in [Halpern and Kapron, 1994].
operator and M (≡ ¬K¬) for the possibility operator.

2We here use K as the symbol for the necessity (= knowledge)

each world) grows much faster than the cardinality of the set
Bn of Kripke structures which do not satisfy M p, and thus
limn→∞ |An|/|Cn| = 1 where Cn is the set of all Kripke
structures with n worlds over the considered alphabet.

Assigning asymptotic probabilities to modal formulas pro-
vides an interesting nonstandard semantics to modal logics
and has important connections to philosophy and to artiﬁcial
intelligence:
PHILOSOPHY: It has been observed [Halpern and Kapron,
1994; Gottlob, 1999] that the modal formulas that are almost
surely true in all Kripke models are exactly those formulas
which are valid in Carnap’s modal logic, exposed in his well-
known foundational treatise Meaning and Necessity [Carnap,
1947]. Carnap argued that precisely these formulas are those
to be considered logically true (L-true). The same logic has
since be considered by various philosophers and logicians
[Gottlob, 1999].
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: Various nonmonotonic
modal logics have been deﬁned in the literature. Examples
are autoepistemic logic [Moore, 1985], nonmonotonic logics
K, S4, etc. [Marek and Truszczy´nski, 1993], the logic MBNF
[Lifschitz, 1994] and the logic of minimal knowledge S5G
[Halpern and Moses, 1985]. In these logics, the modal opera-
tor K is interpreted as an epistemic operator of knowledge or
of belief. As observed in [Gottlob, 1999], the formulas that
can be derived from an empty set of premises in all these log-
ics precisely coincide with those formulas which are almost
surely true in all Kripke structures. This set of formulas is fur-
thermore identical to the stable set [Stalnaker, 1993] based on
the empty set of formulas, thus, in a sense, to the “absolute”
stable set, containing only those formulas that are epistemic
consequences of the empty theory, i.e., that can be assumed
in the case of total factual ignorance (for a deﬁnition of stable
sets, see Section 4). We thus retain that in nonmonotonic and
epistemic logics, in absence of further knowledge, a modal
formula is considered true if and only if this formula is al-
most surely valid.

Reasoning and Asymptotic Conditional Truth. While al-
most sure validity provides an appealing probabilistic seman-
tics of truth in the case of total factual ignorance, this does
not yet allow us to reason on the basis of premises, which
is the the most important goal of all logical formalisms, and,
in particular, of nonmonotonic and epistemic logics. In the
setting of limit probabilities, the inference ϕ |= ψ of a (pos-

sibly modal) formula ψ from a knowledge base (theory) ϕ
would most intuitively correspond to the statement that the
conditional probability P (ψ | ϕ) is asymptotically equal to 1.
Assuming a uniform probability distribution of Kripke struc-
tures, this means that for the sets An and Bn of Kripke mod-
els of size n satisfying ψ ∧ ϕ and ϕ, respectively, the limit
limn→∞ |An|/|Bn| exists and is equal to 1.

There is, in general, no 0-1 law for conditional proba-
bilities in our setting, which immediately follows from pre-
vious results (see e.g. [Grove et al., 1996b]) and from the
fact that modal logic corresponds to a fragment of function-
free ﬁrst-order logic. The existence and determination of
conditional probabilities in ﬁrst and higher order logics has
been the subject of several studies [Grove et al., 1996b;
1996a]. However, to our best knowledge, conditional prob-
abilities for modal logics have never been studied.

Observe that reasoning via conditional limit probabilities
as explained above clearly constitutes a form of nonmono-
tonic reasoning. For example, if p is a propositional letter,
then |=lim M p but K¬p (cid:54)|=lim M p, thus, adding a premise
may invalidate a consequence (here |=lim denotes inference
of almost sure formulas under conditional limit probabili-
ties). The nonmonotonic behaviour of conditional inference
has been pointed out in the context of FO and higher order
classical logic (see e.g. [Grove et al., 1996b]). We deem
the context of modal logic particularly interesting, because
most nonmonotonic logics that have been deﬁned are modal
logics.
It would thus be very interesting to know how the
nonmonotonic modal logic obtained from conditional limit
probabilities of Kripke structures relates to well-known and
well-studied nonmonotonic modal logics.
Nonmonotonic Modal Logics. For every “classical”
monotonic system of modal logic S, a nonmonotonic version
NM-S is obtained by the following deﬁnition: A set E of
modal formulas is an NM-S-expansion of a knowledge base
ϕ iff E = CnS(ϕ ∪ {¬Kγ|γ ∈ LK(A) − E}), where
CnS is the consequence operator according to modal logic
S and LK(A) is the underlying modal language, i.e., the set
of all possible modal formulas over the alphabet of proposi-
tions A3. In particular, Moore’s autoepistemic logic corre-
sponds to NM-KD45. For more background, consult [Marek
and Truszczy´nski, 1993].

It was often criticized that the above ﬁxed-point equation
is somewhat too liberal, because it allows a theory to have ex-
pansions that are not sufﬁciently “grounded” in the premises
and contain positive knowledge that a rational agent should
never conclude from the premises. For this reason, ground
nonmonotonic modal logics have been deﬁned by restrict-
ing the introspection of the agent to non-modal sentences.
The notion of groundedness has a rather intuitive motivation:
in fact, it corresponds to discarding any reasoning based on
epistemic assumptions, which, for example, would enable the
agent to conclude that something is true in the world, by as-
suming to know it. The ﬁxed-point equation deﬁning a SG-
expansion of ϕ is: E = CnS(ϕ ∪ {¬Kγ | γ ∈ L(A)− E}),
where L(A) denotes the set of all objective (i.e., non-modal)
3This deﬁnition is applicable to a large range of modal log-
ics, but a collapse happens at S5 because NM-S5=S5 [Marek and
Truszczy´nski, 1993].

formulas of the underlying propositional language. Accord-
ing to this equation, we can associate a logic SG to each modal
logic S. Given ϕ ∈ LK(A), ψ ∈ LK(A), we say that ψ is
entailed by ϕ in SG (and write ϕ |=SG ψ) iff ψ belongs to all
SG-expansions for ϕ.
Among all ground nonmonotonic logics, the logic S5G
(which, unlike NM-S5, is a true nonmonotonic logic) has
received considerable attention in the literature and is gen-
erally referred to as the logic of minimal knowledge [Halpern
and Moses, 1985] (or the logic of maximal ignorance).
In
fact, independently from its ﬁxed-point characterization, S5G
was characterized on a semantic basis, by means of a pref-
erence criterion among the models of an agent’s knowl-
edge selecting just those models in which objective knowl-
edge (i.e, the set of formulas of type Kϕ such that ϕ ∈
L(A)) is minimal [Halpern and Moses, 1985; Shoham, 1987;
Lifschitz, 1994]. As shown in [Shoham, 1987], S5G has a
simple, elegant model theory: The S5G models of a theory
T are precisely those Kripke structures which are univer-
sal (i.e., totally connected) and are maximal set of worlds
(w.r.t.
set-containment). For details on ground nonmono-
tonic modal logics and S5G, see [Halpern and Moses, 1985;
Lifschitz, 1994; Donini et al., 1997].
Main Problems Studied. The investigations reported in
this paper were motivated by the following questions:

1. Given a formula ϕ, which formulas ψ are almost surely
true in the Kripke models of ϕ, i.e., how can we charac-
terize the formulas ψ that are true with limit probability
one in the Kripke models of ϕ, when the size of these
Kripke models grows towards inﬁnity?

2. Given that modal inference under almost sure validity
constitutes a form of nonmonotonic reasoning, to which
of the nonmonotonic modal logics from the above-
mentioned plethora of logics does this form of reasoning
best correspond?
3. Can we characterize the set of formulas ϕ that guaran-
tee a 0-1 law for the asymptotic probability P (ψ|ϕ) for
arbitrary modal formulas ψ?

4. What is the complexity of modal reasoning based on

asymptotic conditional probabilities?

For studying these questions, we make a very weak as-
sumption on ϕ, which assures that ϕ does not contradict some
principles of knowledge: we assume that ϕ is S5-consistent,
i.e., we assume that ϕ is consistent with the axioms of (mono-
tonic) S5, which means that ϕ admits at least one S5-model.
This assumption is indeed very weak. It does neither mean
that ϕ contains the S5 axioms, or that these axioms should
follow from ϕ, nor that ϕ has to be interpreted under S5
Kripke structures only. Our assumption merely requires that
formulas such as Kp ∧ K¬p which bluntly contradict some
axioms of (monotonic) S5 cannot be deduced from ϕ.
If
ϕ satisﬁes this requirement, we say that ϕ is knowledge-
consistent. We make this assumption because knowledge-
inconsistent theories are well-known to be inconsistent for
all currently known nonmonotonic modal logics anyway, i.e.,
in each such nonmonotonic logic, a knowledge-inconsistent
formula ϕ entails a contradiction and thus all formulas of
the modal language LK(A).
In particular, with regard to
our goal of comparing asymptotic conditional reasoning to

nonmonotonic modal logics, there is no point to consider
knowledge-inconsistent modal premises. Moreover, we char-
acterize asymptotic conditional reasoning when the premise
is a ﬂat modal formula, i.e., a formula without nested occur-
rences of the modal operator. The ﬂat fragment of a modal
logic of knowledge is certainly a very important (if not the
most important) syntactically restricted fragment. It consists
of the Boolean closure of knowledge bases, i.e., of objec-
tive theories under the K operator.
In particular, the ﬂat
fragment in S5G is extremely powerful and expressive. As
shown in [Rosati, 1998], via appropriate translations, this
fragment captures the well-known formalisms of default logic
and logic programming under the stable model semantics. In
the present paper we limit our attention to this ﬂat fragment.
However, we think that (by slightly more involved methods)
our results carry over to the fully nested fragment (i.e., the
fragment with nesting depth greater than 1).
Results. By ﬁrst answering the second of the above-stated
research questions, we show the following main result:
Answer to Question 2: ϕ almost surely entails ψ iff ψ is en-
tailed by ϕ in S5G.

This result gives a fresh probabilistic semantics to the well-
known nonmonotonic modal logic S5G, providing a new jus-
tiﬁcation for S5G based on probabilistic rationality. At the
same time, it provides the answers to our questions 1 and 4,
too. In fact, as already mentioned, reasoning in S5G has pre-
cise characterizations in terms of model-theory and complex-
ity, hence the same characterizations now apply to asymptotic
conditional reasoning over Kripke models:
Answer to Question 1: ϕ almost surely entails ψ iff ψ is sat-
isﬁed by all Kripke models of ϕ that are universal and have a
maximal set of worlds.
Answer to Question 4: Deciding whether ϕ almost surely en-
tails ψ is Πp

2-complete.4

A theory is honest [Halpern and Moses, 1985] iff it has
exactly one S5G-model. It has been argued that the epistemic
state of a perfectly rational agent is necessarily honest, e.g.,
it could not be of the form (KT1) ∨ (KT2) where T1 and
T2 are theories that contradict each other. Honest premises
drastically simplify asymptotic conditional reasoning:
Answer to Question 3: The class of knowledge-consistent
premises ϕ that imply a 0-1 law is exactly the class of honest
formulas. In other words, the honest formulas are precisely
the formulas ϕ such that, for all ψ, the asymptotic probability
that ψ holds in the structures in which ϕ is valid is either 0
or 1. Moreover, asymptotic conditional reasoning based on
honest theories is only Θp

2-complete.

Due to space limitations, we can only include the sketches

of some results in the present version of the paper.
2 Preliminaries
We assume familiarity with modal logics K and S5. We deal
with a propositional alphabet A such that either A is ﬁnite
and ﬁxed, i.e., it is the same for every problem instance, or A
is not bounded, but each problem instance comes along with

a ﬁnite alphabet A as part of the input. We denote by L(A)
the set of propositional (or objective) formulas over A, de-
note by LK(A) the set of modal formulas over A, and denote
by LF
K(A) the set of ﬂat modal formulas, i.e., the subset of
LK(A) of formulas over A satisfying the following abstract
syntax:
ϕ ::= Kf | ¬ϕ | ϕ1 ∧ ϕ2, where f ∈ L(A)
We also use the symbol true to denote the formula a ∨ ¬a,
and the symbol false to denote the formula a ∧ ¬a.

We now recall some auxiliary deﬁnitions that we will use
in the following sections [Marek and Truszczy´nski, 1993;
Donini et al., 1997]. Given ϕ ∈ LK(A), we denote by
MA(ϕ) the set of modal atoms from ϕ, i.e., the set of sub-
formulas of the form Kψ occurring in ϕ. In the following,
we say that an occurrence of a modal atom Kψ in a formula
ϕ ∈ LK(A) is strict if it does not lie within the scope of a
modal operator.
Given a partition (P, N) of the set MA(ϕ) and a formula
ψ ∈ LK(A), we denote by ψ(P, N) the formula obtained
from ψ by substituting each strict occurrence in ψ of a modal
atom in P with true, and each strict occurrence in ψ of a
modal atom in N with false. Notice that, if P ∪ N contains
MA(ψ), then ψ(P, N) is a propositional formula.
Let ϕ ∈ LK(A) and let (P, N) be a partition of
MA(ϕ). We denote by obj ϕ(P, N) the propositional formula

obj ϕ(P, N) = ϕ(P, N) ∧(cid:86)

Kψ∈P ψ(P, N).

Given a partition (P, N) of the set MA(ϕ), we say that
(P, N) is S5-consistent with ϕ if (P, N) satisﬁes the follow-
ing conditions: (1) the propositional formula obj ϕ(P, N) is
satisﬁable; (2) for each Kψ ∈ N, the propositional formula
obj ϕ(P, N) ∧ ¬ψ(P, N) is satisﬁable. It is immediate to see
that there exists a partition of MA(ϕ) S5-consistent with ϕ iff
ϕ is knowledge-consistent, i.e., there exists an S5-structure S
such that (w,S) |= Kϕ where w is a world of S. Finally,
given a structure S = (cid:104)W, R, V (cid:105) and a world w ∈ W , we say
that (P, N) is the partition of MA(ϕ) satisﬁed by (w,S) if,
for each Kψ ∈ MA(ϕ), (w,S) |= Kψ iff Kψ ∈ P .
3 Strong almost-sure conditional validity
In the work of Halpern and Kapron [Halpern and Kapron,
1994], almost sure structure validity is studied by considering
all possible Kripke structures equally likely, i.e., uniformly
distributed. This amounts to assume that that every proposi-
tional variable is true with probability 1/2 in a randomly cho-
sen world. Under such an assumption, the asymptotic prob-
ability of ϕ w.r.t. a propositional alphabet A corresponds to
the limit limn→∞ |W ϕ
n|/|Wn|, where: (i) Wn denotes the set
of all n-structures over A, i.e., the structures with n worlds
of the form (cid:104)W, R, V (cid:105), where W = {1, . . . , n}, the accessi-
bility relation R is a binary relation over W , and V is a func-
tion mapping each world into a propositional interpretation
over A; (ii) W ϕ
n denotes the set of all n-structures in which ϕ
holds; (iii) |S| represents the cardinality of a set S. Moreover,
under the above uniform probability assumption, asymptotic
conditional probability of ψ given ϕ corresponds to the limit
limn→∞ |W (ϕ∧ψ)

|/|W ϕ
n|.

It would be more appealing to consider the notion of strong
almost sure validity, where the asymptotic probability of a
formula ψ is required to be equal to 1 for every possible

probability distribution assigning rational truth probabilities
to the propositional variables. It turns out that in the context
of [Halpern and Kapron, 1994] both concepts are equivalent,
thus all relevant results of [Halpern and Kapron, 1994] extend
to strong almost sure validity. In the context of conditional
probabilities, these concepts differ, however. In this paper we
choose to characterize the notion of strong almost sure con-
ditional validity, which is independent of a particular ﬁxed
probability distribution. However, we will use (Section 4) the
concept of almost sure conditional validity (i.e., the one cor-
responding to the uniform distribution of Kripke structures)
as a tool for establishing (Section 5) our main result on strong
almost sure validity.
More formally, we associate to each propositional atom
a ∈ A a rational probability m such that 0 < m < 1, which
is interpreted as the probability that the proposition a is true.
Such an assignment is part of the input. Assignments giving
probability 1 (resp. 0) to a are not considered, since in such
cases the proposition a is certainly true (resp. false) and all its
occurrences in a formula can be eliminated in a simple way.
We assume without loss of generality that m is a ﬁnite sum of
the negative powers of two. Hence, we say that P is a proba-
bility assignment over an alphabet A if P is a function map-
ping each propositional symbol from A to a rational number
m such that there exists a ﬁnite binary sequence m1 . . . mp
such that m =

(cid:80)p

It is immediate to verify the following relationship between
the cardinality of a set of interpetations and the number of
different n-structures deﬁned over such interpretations.5
Lemma 3.1 Let I be a set of propositional interpretations,
and let Wn be the set of n-structures deﬁned using the set of
interpretations I. Then, |Wn| = |I|n · 2n2.
Let ϕ, ψ ∈ LK(A), and let P be a probability assignment
over A. Then, pn
P(ψ|ϕ) denotes the probability that ψ is
valid in the n-structures in which ϕ is valid, under the proba-
bility assignment P. We are now ready to deﬁne almost-sure
and strong almost-sure conditional validity.
Deﬁnition 3.2 (P-almost-sure validity) Let P be a proba-
bility assignment over A. We say that ψ conditioned by
ϕ is P-almost-surely valid if limn→∞ pn
P(ψ|ϕ) = 1, i.e.,
the asymptotic probability that ψ conditioned by ϕ is valid
is 1 under the probability assignment P. Conversely, if
P(ψ|ϕ) < 1, then we say that ψ conditioned by
limn→∞ pn
ϕ is not P-almost-surely valid.
Deﬁnition 3.3 (strong-almost-sure validity) ψ conditioned
P(ψ|ϕ) =
by ϕ is strongly almost-surely valid if limn→∞ pn
1 for each probability assignment P over A. Conversely,
if there exists a probability assignment P over A such that
P(ψ|ϕ) < 1, then we say that ψ conditioned by
limn→∞ pn
ϕ is not strongly almost-surely valid.
We denote by SAS(ϕ,A) the set of formulas ψ from LK(A)
such that ψ conditioned by ϕ is strongly almost-surely valid.
4 Counting structures
In this section we prove the correspondence between the no-
tion of stable set in nonmonotonic modal logics and strong

1996b; 1996a].

almost-sure conditional validity with respect to objective for-
mulas, and establish a ﬁrst correspondence between S5G and
strong almost-sure conditional validity in modal logic.
From now on, we denote by h the number of propositional
interpretations of A, i.e., h = 2|A|. Moreover, given a for-
mula f ∈ L(A), we denote by hf the number of interpreta-
tions of A satisfying f.

We start our analysis by studying the properties of the set
of n-structures for f, i.e., the n-structures in which a propo-
sitional formula f is valid. First of all, from Lemma 3.1, it
follows that the number of n-structures for f is hf · 2n2.

Then, we recall the deﬁnition of stable set of modal for-
mulas. Let f be a satisﬁable propositional formula over the
propositional alphabet A. The stable set of f in A (de-
noted by Stable(f,A)) is the unique set of modal formulas
T ⊂ LK(A) that satisﬁes the following conditions: (i) for
each ψ ∈ L(A), ψ ∈ T iff f ⊃ ψ is a tautology; (ii) if ψ ∈ T
then Kψ ∈ T ; (iii) if ψ ∈ LK(A) − T then ¬Kψ ∈ T ;
(iv) T is closed under propositional consequence [Marek and
Truszczy´nski, 1993].

Next, we prove the correspondence between formulas
strongly almost-surely valid with respect to an objective for-
mula f and the formulas in Stable(f,A). The proof is easily
obtained by extending an analogous result in [Halpern and
Kapron, 1994].
Lemma 4.1 Let f ∈ L(A) be a satisﬁable objective formula.
Then, SAS(f,A) = Stable(f,A).

We now introduce two auxiliary lemmas.

We now deﬁne S5G-preferred partitions of modal atoms.
Deﬁnition 4.4 (S5G-preferred partition) Let ϕ ∈ LK(A). A
partition (P, N) of MA(ϕ) is S5G-preferred for ϕ if (P, N)

is S5-consistent with ϕ and there exists no other parti-
tion (P (cid:48), N(cid:48)) (cid:54)= (P, N) of MA(ϕ) such that (i) (P (cid:48), N(cid:48))
is S5-consistent with ϕ; and (ii) the propositional formula
obj ϕ(P, N) ∧ ¬obj ϕ(P (cid:48), N(cid:48)) is not satisﬁable.

It

is

immediate to verify that S5G-preferred parti-
tions of MA(ϕ) are in one-to-one correspondence with
S5G-expansions of ϕ:
in particular, each such parti-
tion (P, N) identiﬁes the S5G-expansion corresponding to
Stable(obj ϕ(P, N),A).
We are now ready to show a ﬁrst fundamental step towards
the correspondence between S5G and strong almost-sure con-
ditional validity: For each knowledge-consistent modal for-
mula ϕ, to compute (strong) almost sure conditional validity
we can safely consider only the set of n-structures in which
all worlds satisfy one of the partitions of MA(ϕ) that are S5G-
preferred for ϕ.
Theorem 4.5 Let ϕ be a ﬂat, knowledge-consistent formula,
let W ϕ
n denote the set of n-structures for ϕ, and let Dn be
the union of the sets of n-structures for ϕ in which all worlds
satisfy the same partition (P, N) of MA(ϕ), where (P, N) is
S5G-preferred for ϕ. Then, limn→∞ |Dn|/|W ϕ
Proof. Let C(cid:48)
n be the union of the sets of n-structures for
obj ϕ(P, N) ∧ µ(N) for each partition (P, N) of MA(ϕ) that
is S5-consistent with ϕ. First, by Lemma 4.2 and Lemma 4.3
it follows that limn→∞ |C(cid:48)
n| = 1. Moreover, let Cn be
the union of the sets of n-structures for obj ϕ(P, N) ∧ µ(N)

5 Asymptotic conditional probability and S5G
In this section we prove the main result of the paper, which
establishes the correspondence between strong almost-sure
conditioned validity and entailment in the logic S5G. To this
aim, we need some preliminary deﬁnitions and properties.
Let A(cid:48) be the set of propositional atoms ai such that a ∈
A and 1 ≤ i ≤ m. We deﬁne the canonical probability
2 for each a ∈
assignment Pc over A(cid:48) as follows: Pc(a) = 1
A(cid:48). Let A be a propositional alphabet and let If be the set
of propositional interpretations over A that satisfy f. The
canonical probability of a propositional formula f, denoted
by cp(f), is deﬁned as cp(f) = |If|
2|A| .

The following auxiliary lemma establishes a sufﬁcient
condition over the partitions of MA(ϕ) which implies that
Pc(ψ|ϕ) < 1.
limn→∞ pn
Lemma 5.1 Let ϕ ∈ LF
If there exists a partition
(P, N) of MA(ϕ) such that: (1) (P, N) is S5G-preferred for
ϕ; (2) for each partition (P (cid:48), N(cid:48)) that is S5G-preferred for ϕ,
cp(obj ϕ(P, N)) ≥ cp(obj ϕ(P (cid:48), N(cid:48))); (3) ψ does not hold in
the structures for obj ϕ(P, N), then lim

then,
is S5G-preferred for ϕ,

Let a ∈ A and let P(a) = k where k is a rational number
satisfying the deﬁnition of probability assignment. Then, we
can construct a propositional formula f k(a) deﬁned over an
alphabet Ak = {a1, . . . , amk} (where mk is a number de-
pending on k) such that P(a) = cp(f k(a)). Then, given a
probability assignment P over A, we deﬁne τP(ϕ) as the for-
mula obtained from ϕ by replacing, for each a ∈ A, each
occurrence of a in ϕ with fP(a)(a). Now, in order to prove
our main result, we need some auxiliary lemmas.
Lemma 5.2 Let ψ ∈ LK(A), and let f ∈ L(A). Then, ψ ∈
SAS(f,A) iff τP(ψ) ∈ SAS(τP(f),Ak).
Lemma 5.3 Let ϕ, ψ ∈ LK(A).
for each par-
tition (P, N) that
the partition
(τP(P ), τP(N)) is S5G-preferred for τP(ϕ), while for each
partition (τP(P ), τP(N)) that is S5G-preferred for τP(ϕ),
the partition (P, N) is S5G-preferred for ϕ.
Lemma 5.4 Let ϕ ∈ LK(A). If a partition (P, N) of MA(ϕ)
is S5G-preferred for ϕ, then the stable set of obj ϕ(P, N)
in A is an S5G-expansion for ϕ. Moreover, if a set T ⊂
LK(A) is an S5G-expansion for ϕ, then there exists a parti-
tion (P, N) of MA(ϕ) such that (P, N) is S5G-preferred for
ϕ and Stable(obj ϕ(P, N),A) = T .
K(A), ψ ∈ LK(A), and let ϕ be a

strongly almost-surely valid iff ϕ |=S5G ψ.
First, if ϕ |=S5G ψ, then, from deﬁnition of en-

tailment in S5G and from Lemma 5.4 it follows that, for
each partition (P, N) that is S5G-preferred for ϕ, ψ belongs
to Stable(obj ϕ(P, N),A), consequently, by Lemma 4.1,
ψ ∈ SAS(obj ϕ(P, N),A). Hence, by Lemma 5.2 and
Lemma 5.3, for each probability assignment P over A,
τP(ψ) ∈ SAS(τP(obj ϕ(P, N)),Ak). Therefore, by Theo-
Pc(τP(ψ)|τP(ϕ)) = 1, which implies
rem 4.5, limn→∞ pn
that ψ conditioned by ϕ is strongly almost-surely valid.

Conversely, if ϕ (cid:54)|=S5G ψ, then by Lemma 5.4 it follows that
there exists a partition (P, N) that is S5G-preferred for ϕ and
such that ψ does not belong to Stable(obj ϕ(P, N),A), con-
sequently, by Lemma 4.1, ψ (cid:54)∈ SAS(obj ϕ(P, N),A). There-
fore, by Lemma 5.2, τP(ψ) (cid:54)∈ SAS(τP(obj ϕ(P, N)),Ak).
Moreover, it is immediate to verify the existence a prob-
ability assignment P(cid:48) over A such that, for each partition
(P (cid:48), N(cid:48)) that is S5G-preferred for ϕ, cp(τP(cid:48)(obj ϕ(P, N))) ≥
cp(τP(cid:48)(obj ϕ(P (cid:48), N(cid:48)))). Consequently, by Lemma 5.1, it fol-
Pc(τP(ψ)|τP(ϕ)) < 1, i.e., ψ condi-
lows that limn→∞ pn
tioned by ϕ is not strongly almost-surely valid.

6 Complexity results
As explained above, we consider both the case in which A is
a ﬁxed ﬁnite alphabet and the case in which it is considered
If A is ﬁnite and ﬁxed,
as ﬁnite but not ﬁxed in advance.
then, based on the algorithm for entailment in S5G reported
in [Donini et al., 1997] it can be easily shown that entailment
in S5G can be decided in polynomial time, and therefore, by
Theorem 5.5, strong almost-sure conditional validity can be
decided in polynomial time as well. Consider now the case
of a ﬁnite, non-ﬁxed alphabet A.
Theorem 6.1 Let ϕ ∈ LF
K(A), ψ ∈ LK(A), and let ϕ be
a knowledge-consistent formula. Deciding whether ψ condi-
tioned by ϕ is strongly almost-surely valid is a Πp
2-complete
problem.
Proof.
Follows immediately from Theorem 5.5 and from
the fact that the entailment problem ϕ |=S5G ψ when ϕ ∈
LF
K(A) is Πp
2-complete, which is an immediate consequence
of Corollary 4.12 of [Donini et al., 1997] and of Theorem 11
of [Rosati, 1998]).

Next, we study a subclass of ﬂat modal formulas for which
deciding strong almost-sure conditional validity is computa-
tionally easier than in the general case: the class of honest
formulas, introduced by [Halpern and Moses, 1985]. A ﬂat
formula ϕ is honest iff it has exactly one S5G-model. It is
known that deciding whether ϕ is honest is a Θp
2-complete
problem. Moreover, if ϕ is honest, then deciding the entail-
ment ϕ |=S5G ψ is also Θp
2-complete. Therefore, from Theo-
rem 5.5 the following property holds.
Theorem 6.2 Let ϕ ∈ LF
K(A), ψ ∈ LK(A), and let ϕ be
a honest formula. Deciding whether ψ conditioned by ϕ is
strongly almost-surely valid is Θp

2-complete.

Furthermore, the notion of honesty precisely characterizes
the subclass of formulas, among the formulas ϕ such that Kϕ
is S5-consistent, that condition according to a 0-1 law, i.e.,
P(ψ|ϕ) = 1 for each probability
such that either limn→∞ pn
assignment P or limn→∞ pn
P(ψ|ϕ) = 0 for each probability
assignment P, which is immediately implied by Theorem 5.5
and by the fact that a honest formula has a single S5G-model.
7 Conclusions
The present work can be extended in several directions. In
particular, we are currently investigating the following is-
sues: (i) strong almost-sure validity for (classes of) condi-
tioning formulas with nested occurrences of modalities; (ii)

extending the study of asymptotic conditional validity to the
framework of multimodal logic; (iii) computing P-almost-
sure conditional validity, i.e., the value of the asymptotic con-
ditional validity for a given probability distribution P of the
truth of primitive propositions.
