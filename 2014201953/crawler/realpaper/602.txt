Abstract 

We empirically study phase transitions of the asym(cid:173)
metric Traveling Salesman.  Using random instances 
of up to  1,500 cities,  we show that many properties 
of the problem, including the backbone and optimal 
tour cost, experience sharp transitions as the preci(cid:173)
sion of intercity distances increases across a critical 
value.  We also show that the average computational 
cost  of the  well-known  branch-and-bound  subtour 
elimination algorithm  for the  problem  also  exhibits 
a threshold behavior, transitioning from easy to diffi(cid:173)
cult as the distance precision increases. These results 
provide strong positive  evidences to  a decade-long 
open question regarding the existence of phase tran(cid:173)
sitions of the Traveling Salesman. 

Introduction 

1 
Phase transition refers to  such  a phenomenon of a system in 
which some global properties change rapidly and dramatically 
when  a  control  parameter  crosses  a  critical  value.  A  sim(cid:173)
ple  example  of phase  transition  is  water  changing  from  the 
liquid  phase  to  the  solid  phase  when  the  temperature  drops 
below  the  freezing  point.  Phase  transitions  of combinato(cid:173)
rial  problems  and  threshold  behavior  of combinatorial  algo(cid:173)
rithms  have  drawn  much  attention  in  recent  years  [12]. 
It 
has  been  shown  that  many  combinatorial  decision problems 
have phase transitions,  such as Boolean satisfiability  [7;  21; 
22], graph coloring [7] and number partitioning [4]. 

Another  useful  concept  for  characterizing  combinatorial 
problems is that of backbones  [17; 22].  A backbone variable 
refers to such a variable that has a fixed value in all solutions 
of a problem.  All such backbone variables are collectively re(cid:173)
ferred to as the backbone of the problem. The fraction of back(cid:173)
bone, the percentage of variables in the backbone, reflects the 
constrainedness  of the  problem  and  directly  affects  an  algo(cid:173)
rithm searching for a solution.  The larger the backbone, the 
more tightly constrained the problem becomes.

In contrast to numerous phase-transition studies on decision 
problems, the research on the phase transitions and backbones 
of optimization problems  is  limited.  An  early  work  on  the 
symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem, which is an optimiza(cid:173)
tion problem, introduced the concept of backbones and left an 
open question of whether there exists a phase transition of the 
TSP [17].  However, this question has not be addressed since 
1985.  One  of the  most rigorous phase-transition results  was 
obtained on number partitioning [4], an optimization problem. 
However, the phase transition analyzed was the existence of a 
perfect partition of a set of integers, which is in essence a de(cid:173)
cision problem.  In our early work, we studied the relationship 
between the phase transitions of satisfiability, a decision prob(cid:173)
lem, and maximum satisfiability, an optimization problem [24]. 
In addition, the relationship between backbones and average-
case algorithmic complexity has also been considered [23]. 

In  this  paper,  we  study  the  phase  transitions  of the  asym(cid:173)
metric  Traveling  Salesman  Problem  (TSP),  which  has  many 
real-world applications such as scheduling and routing.  The 
TSP  [13;  18]  is  an  architypical  combinatorial  optimization 
problem,  and  also very  often  a touchstone for  combinatorial 
algorithms. 
In  this  paper,  we  consider  the  asymmetric  TSP 
(ATSP), where the distance from one city to another may not 
be  necessarily the same  as  the  distance  in  the  reverse direc(cid:173)
tion. The ATSP is more general and difficult than the symmet(cid:173)
ric TSP (STSP). Our results provide strong positive evidences 
to the long-standing open question of [ 17] using the more gen(cid:173)
eral form of the problem.  Another reason that we choose the 
ATSP rather than the symmetric TSP is that many properties of 
the assignment problem [19], a problem closely related to the 
ATSP, are known (Section 3.2) and useful to our analysis. 

Specifically, using random problem instances of up to 1,500 
cities,  we  empirically  reveal  that  the  average  optimal  tour 
length, the accuracy of the best cost function (the assignment 
problem), and the backbone of the ATSP undergo sharp phase 
transitions.  The  control  parameter  is  the  precision  of inter(cid:173)
city  distances  which  is  typically  represented  by  the  number 
of digits  for  the  distances.  Note  that  these  results  are  algo(cid:173)
rithm  independent  and  properties  of the  problem.  Further(cid:173)
more, we show that the average computational cost of the well-
known  branch-and-bound  subtour  elimination  algorithm  [1; 
3]  for the  ATSP  exhibits  a  threshold behavior,  in  which  the 
computational cost grows abruptly and dramatically as the dis(cid:173)
tance precision increases. 

Two related results are worth mentioning.  The research in 
[26] revealed that the average complexity of the subtour elim-
SATISFIABILITY 

ination algorithm for the ATSP is controlled by the number of 
distinct intercity distances.  We will further extend this result in 
Section 5. However, these results are algorithm specific, which 
may  not  necessarily  reflect  intrinsic  features  of the  underly(cid:173)
ing problem. The research in [11] studied the decision version 
of the  symmetric  TSP.  Specifically,  it  analyzed the  probabil(cid:173)
ity  that a tour of length less than  a specific  value exists for a 
random symmetric euclidean TSP, showing that the probabil(cid:173)
ity has a one-to-zero phase transition as the length of the tar(cid:173)
geting tour increases.  Note that the phase-transition  result in 
[ l l] does not address the open question of [ 17] which is on the 
optimization version of the problem. 

2  The Problem and Algorithms 
Given  n  cities  and  a  matrix  D  =  (dlJ)  that  defines  the  dis(cid:173)
tances or costs of pairs of cities, the Traveling Salesman Prob(cid:173)
lem  (TSP)  is  to  find  a  minimum-cost  complete  tour  visiting 
each city once.  When the cost matrix is asymmetric, i.e., dij 
is not necessarily equal to d  j,i,  the problem is the asymmetric 
TSP (ATSP), which  is more'difficult than the  STSP,  for both 
optimization and approximation [14]. 

The  branch-and-bound  (BnB)  subtour  elimination  algo(cid:173)
rithm  [1;  3]  solves  the  ATSP  using  the  assignment problem 
(AP) as a lower-bound cost function.  The AP, which can be 
solved  in  0(n3),  is to  assign  to  each city i  another city j  with 
cost equal to distance d i,j, so that the total cost of all such as(cid:173)
signments is minimized  [19].  If the AP solution happens to be 
a complete tour, it is also an ATSP solution. 

The BnB search takes the ATSP as the root of the state space 
and solves the AP  to the  root node.  If the AP solution  is not 
a complete tour,  decompose  it  into  subproblems by  selecting 
a subtour from the AP solution and generate subproblems by 
excluding some edges in the subtour to eliminate the subtour. 
We used the Carpaneto-Toth subtour-elimination heuristic  [6] 
in our implementation, which generates no duplicate subprob-
lem, so that the search space is a tree. Next, select as the current 
problem a new subproblem that has been generated but not yet 
expanded. This process continues until there is no unexpanded 
problem, or all unexpanded problems have costs greater than 
or equal to the cost of the best complete tour found so far. 

Our algorithm is, in principle, the same as that of [5], which 
is probably the best known complete algorithm for the ATSP. 
The main difference between the two is that we use depth-first 
branch-and-bound (DFBnB), due to its low space requirement, 
while [5] used best-first search.  We further extended our DF(cid:173)
BnB algorithm to finding all optimal solutions and backbones. 

3  Previous, Related Results 
Two previous lines of work influenced this research and helped 
reveal the properties of the ATSP. 

3.1  Phase transitions in  tree search 
To  capture  the  tree  search  of the  DFBnB  algorithm  for  the 
ATSP, we first introduce an abstract tree model. An incremen(cid:173)
tal tree [15; 20; 25], T(m, d), is a tree with depth d y and inde(cid:173)
pendent and  identically  distributed  (i.i.d.)  random branching 
factors with mean m.  Edges are assigned costs that are finite 
and nonnegative i.i.d.  variables. The cost of a node is the sum 
of the edge costs along the path from the root to that node. An 
edge cost is nothing but the difference between a node cost and

The above results mean that the cost of an optimal goal node 
almost surely undergoes a phase transition from a linear func(cid:173)
tion of depth d to a constant when 
increases beyond one. 
Meanwhile,  the  expected  complexity  of best-first  search  and 
DFBnB changes dramatically from exponential to polynomial 
in d as mpo is reduced below one. 

3.2  Relationship between  AP  and  ATSP 
The assignment problem (AP) cost function and its relationship 
with the ATSP have been a research interest for a long time [8; 
9;  10;  16].  The  relationship  between  the  AP  cost,  AP(D), 
and the ATSP  cost,  ATSP(D),  has remarkably different char(cid:173)
acteristics  under  different  distance  distributions  of a  random 
matrix  D.  The  AP(D)  and  ATSP{D)  can  be  the  same  with 
a high probability, or they can differ from each other,  with a 
high  probability,  by  a  function  of n.  If the  expected number 
of zeros  in  a  row  of D  approaches  infinity  when 
AP(D)  =  ATSP{D)  with  a  probability  tending  to  one  [9]. 
However,  if the  distances  are  uniform  over 
AP(D)  =  ATSP(D)  with  a probability  going  to  zero,  where 
grows to  infinity  with  n  [9].  Indeed,  when the  entities of 

D  are  uniform  over  [0,1],  E(ATSP(D)  - 
where Co is a positive constant [10]. 

AP(D)) 

4  Phase Transitions of the ATSP 
The results in the previous section  indicate that the quality of 
the AP function varies significantly, depending on the under(cid:173)
lying distance distribution.  Precisely,  the difference between 
the AP cost, AP(D),  and the ATSP cost,  ATSP(D)  has two 
phases, controlled by the number of zero distances in the dis(cid:173)
tance matrix D.  In one phase, the difference is zero with high 
probability, while in the other phase, the expectation of the dif(cid:173)
ference is a function of the problem size n. 

How  does  the  difference  between  ATSP(D)  and  AP(D) 
change phases?  Does it have a sharp phase transition, or does 
it follow a slow process? Do other properties of the ATSP, such 
as the backbone, also have phase transitions? 

The two-phase result on the accuracy  of the AP  cost  func(cid:173)
tion  discussed  in  Section  3.2  is  in  principle  consistent  with 
the phase-transition result of incremental random trees in Sec(cid:173)
tion  3.1.  The root of the  search tree has a cost equal to the 
AP cost AP(D)  to the problem and an optimal goal  node has 
the  ATSP  tour  cost  ATSP{D). 
If  we  subtract  the  AP  cost 
to the root from every node in the ATSP search tree, the root 
node has cost zero and an optimal goal node has cost equal to 
ATSP(D) 
-  AP(D).  When there are a large number of zero 
distances in D, the AP cost of a child node in a search tree is 
1203 

more likely to be the same as the AP cost of its parent, since 
AP will tend to use the zero distances. Therefore, it is expected 
that more nodes in the search tree will have more than one child 
node having the same cost as their parents. In fact, the concept 
of zero distances  can  be  extended to  minimal-cost distances. 
If the  cost of the minimal  distance  is  known,  we  can  simply 
subtract it  from every distance without affecting the accuracy 
of the AP function. 

4.1  The control parameter 
Furthermore,  the  concept  and  role  of zero  and  minimal  dis(cid:173)
tances can be extended to that of equal distances. The AP to a 
child node is obtained by excluding one arc, and possibly in(cid:173)
cluding some arcs, of a subtour of the AP solution to the parent 
node. With this new restriction, the child AP is then computed 
by constructing a new augmenting path from the starting point 
to the end point of the excluded arc [19]. The child and parent 
AP solutions usually differ by only a relatively small number 
of arcs.  In  other words,  the  child AP  solution  is  derived by 
replacing some arcs in the parent AP solution.  If the numbers 
of distances of equal values are large, it is more likely that the 
child AP cost is equal to the parent AP cost. Conversely, when 
the number of distinct distances is large, it is unlikely the costs 
of two APs will be the same.  When the distances are uniform 
over [0,1, • • •, R — 1], the probability that the child AP cost is 
equal to the parent AP cost will  depend on the range JR.  If R 
is small, relative to the problem size n, this probability will be 
high. In short, for a given problem size, the accuracy of the AP 
cost function is controlled by the number of distinct distances 
in matrix D.  More precisely, the accuracy of the AP is deter(cid:173)
of distinct  distances. 
mined by the fraction, denoted as 

In practice, however, we do not directly control the number 
or the  fraction of distinct distances.  In  addition to  the actual 
structures  of the  "layouts"  of the  cities,  the  precision  of the 
distances  also  affects  the  number  of distinct  distances.  The 
precision of a number is  usually  represented by the  maximal 
number of digits allowed for the number. As a result, the num(cid:173)
ber  of digits  for distances  is  naturally  a  good  choice  for  the 
control parameter. 

The  effect  of a  given  number  of digits  on  the  fraction  of 
distinct distances is relative to the problem size n.  Consider a 
matrix D  with distances  uniformly over 
where the range R is determined by the number of digits b. For 
a fixed b9 the fraction of distinct distances of a larger matrix D 
is obviously smaller than that of a smaller D. Thus, the control 
parameter for the fraction 
of distinct distances must be 
where  f(n)  is  a rescaling function on 
in the form  of 
the effect of the number of digits. 

To find the scaling function 

consider  the  number  of 
distinct distances of matrix D for a given integer range R. The 
problem of finding the number of distinct distances is equiva(cid:173)
lent to the bin-ball problem as follows.  We are given M balls 
and R bins,  and asked to place the balls into the bins.  Each 
ball  is  independently  put  into  one  of the  bins  with  an  equal 
probability.  We  are interested in the fraction of bins that are 
not empty after all the placements.  Here, for asymmetric TSP 
M  =  n2  -  n  balls  correspond to  the  total  number of nondi-
agonal distances of matrix D, and R bins represent the possi(cid:173)
ble integers to be selected from.  Since each ball (distance) is 
thrown independently and uniformly into one of R bins (inte(cid:173)
gers), the probability that one bin is not empty after throwing

Controlled  by  the  effective  number  of  digits 

the  fraction  of distinct  distances 
has  a  phase  transition  of 
its own,  also shown in  Figure  1(a).  The larger the problem, 
the  sharper the transition,  and  there  exists  a  crossover point 
among  the  transitions  of problems  with  different  sizes.  We 
can  examine  the phase  transitions  more  closely  using finite-
size scaling.  Finite-size scaling [2] is a method that has been 
successfully applied to phase transitions in similar systems of 
different sizes.  Based  on  finite-size  scaling,  around a  criti(cid:173)
cal  parameter (temperature), problems of different sizes  tend 
to  be  indistinguishable  except  for  a  change  of  scale  given 
by  a  power  law  in  a  characteristic  length.  Thus, finite-size 
scaling  can  help  to  characterize  a  phase  transition precisely 
around a  critical  point of the  control  parameter as  the  prob(cid:173)
lem scales to infinity.  For the problem at hand, the effective

and the problem

where the error 
bounds represent the 95% confidence intervals.  The rescaled 
phase transitions are shown in Figure 1(b). 

where 

Note  that  the  number of digits  used  for  intercity  distances 
is nothing but a measurement of the precision of the distances. 
The  larger the  number of digits,  the  higher the precision  be(cid:173)
comes.  This agrees with the  common practice of using more 
effective digits to gain precision.  Therefore, the phase transi(cid:173)
tion of the control parameter is in turn determined by the pre(cid:173)
cision  of intercity distances. 

4.2  Phase transitions 
With  the  control  parameter,  the  effective  number  of  digits 
for intercity distances, identified, we are now in a po(cid:173)
sition to investigate possible phase transitions in (1) the ATSP 
cost, (2) the probability that an AP cost is equal to the corre(cid:173)
sponding ATSP  cost,  (3)  the  relative error or accuracy  of the 
AP lower-bound function, and  finally  (4) the backbone of the 
ATSP. The answers to the  first  three problems provides a de(cid:173)
tailed picture on the accuracy of the AP cost function, and the 
answer to the last problem reveals the intrinsic constrainedness 
among the cities as the precision of distances changes. We ex(cid:173)
amine these four problems in turn. 

We generated uniformly random problem instances of 100-, 
200-, 300- to  1,000-cities and  1,500-cities.  Intercity distances 
are independently and uniformly chosen from {0,1,2, • • •, R-
1}  for a given range R,  which  is controlled by the number of 
digits 6. We varied 6, with an increment of 0.1, from 1.0 to 6.0 
for instances with up to  1,000-cities and from  1.0 to 6.5 for in(cid:173)
stances with  1,500-cities. For each combination  of  and  we 
generated  10,000 instances for problems (l)-(3) listed above, 
and  1,000 instances for problem (4) due to its high computa(cid:173)
tional cost.  To make the result figures readable, we only use 
the curves from  100-, 500-,  1,000- and 1,500-city problems. 

There  is  a  phase  transition  in  the  ATSP  tour  cost, 
ATSP(D),  shown  in  Figure 2(a).  The  reported tour costs  are 
obtained by dividing the integer tour costs from the DFBnB al(cid:173)
gorithm by n  x  (R -  1), where n is the number of cities and R

the range of intercity costs.  Equivalently, an intercity distance 
was virtually converted to a real value in [0,1].  By doing this, 
we can verify the existing analytical result on the AP and ATSP 
costs. This will be discussed in detail in the next subsection. 

As  shown,  the ATSP tour cost increases abruptly and dra(cid:173)
matically as the effective number of digits increases, exhibiting 
phase transitions. The transitions become sharper as the prob(cid:173)
lem  becomes  larger,  and  there  exist  crossover points  among 
curves from different problem sizes.  By finite-size scaling, we 
further determine the critical value of the control parameter at 
which the phase transitions occur.  The scaled result is shown 
in  Figure  2(b).  It  is  worthwhile to  mention that the  AP cost 
(not shown) follows almost the same phase-transition pattern. 
Our  numerical  results  show  that  when  the  number of dig(cid:173)
its for intercity distances is very small, for example, less than 
1.9  digits  or  R 
80  for  n  =  1,500,  the  AP  and  ATSP 
costs are equal to zero, meaning that these two costs are the 
same as well.  Given a random distance matrix D, how likely 
is  it  that  an  AP  cost  will  differ  from  the  ATSP  tour cost  as 
the  effective  number  of digits 
increases?  We  address this 
question by examining the probability that an AP cost AP(D) 
is  equal  to  the  corresponding ATSP  cost  ATSP(D)  as  B  in(cid:173)
creases. Figure 3(a) shows the results, averaged over the same 
set of instances  for Figure 2.  As  shown,  the probability that 
AP(D)  =  ATSP(D)  also  experiences phase  transitions.  Fig(cid:173)
ure 3(b) shows the phase transitions after finite-size scaling. 

The results in Figure 3 also imply that the quality of the AP 
function degrades as the effective number of digits 
increases. 
The degradation also follows a phase-transition process.  This 
is  verified by  Figure 4,  using  the  data  from  the  same  set  of 
1205 

ficiently  large  so  that  all  distances  are  distinct,  regardless  of 
problem size, and the quantities to be examined do not change 
substantially after  finite-size  scaling. 
=  2  is also relatively 
small so that we can experiment on large problems. In our im(cid:173)
plementation of the  DFBnB  algorithm,  distances are  integers 
of 4  bytes.  Thus the  number of digits  must be  less  than  9.4 
without causing an overflow in the worst case.  Using 
=  2, 
we can go up to roughly 2,500-city ATSPs in the worst case. 

Table  1  shows the results, with up to 2,900 cities.  The AP 
cost approaches to  1.6439 and the ATSP cost to  1.6444.  The 
accuracy of AP function indeed improves as the problem size 
increases,  with  relative  error  reduced  to  about 
for 
2,900-city problems. 

5  Threshold  Behavior of Subtour Elimination 
The  phase-transition  results  indicate  that  the  ATSP  becomes 
more  constrained  and  difficult  as  the  distance  precision  be(cid:173)
comes higher. We now study how the DFBnB subtour elimina(cid:173)
tion algorithm behaves.  We separate this issue from the phase 
transitions studied before because we now consider the behav(cid:173)
ior of a particular algorithm,  which may not be necessarily a 
feature of the underlying problem. Nevertheless, this is still an 
issue of its own  interest because this  algorithm  is among the 
best known methods for the ATSP, and we hope that a better 
understanding of this  algorithm  can  shed  light on  the  typical 
case complexity of the problem. 

Figure  6(a)  shows  the  average  complexity  of the  DFBnB 
algorithm,  measured  by  the  number of calls  to  the  AP  func(cid:173)
tion.  The result is averaged over the same problem instances 
for each data point as used for the phase transitions in the pre(cid:173)
vious section.  Note that the number of AP calls increases sig(cid:173)
nificantly  from  small  problems to  large  ones  using the  same 
effective  number of digits  for distances.  Thus,  we  normalize 
the result in such a way that for a given problem size, the min(cid:173)
imal and maximal AP calls among all problem instances of the 
same size are mapped to zero and one,  respectively, and the 
other AP  calls  are proportionally adjusted  to  a  ratio between 
0 and  1.  This allows us to compare the results from different 
problem sizes on one  figure.  The curves in Figure 6(a) follow 
a pattern similar to that of the phase transitions in the previous 
section.  The complexity of the  subtour elimination algorithm 
increases  with  the  effective  number of digits,  and  exhibits  a 
threshold behavior similar to phase transitions. Indeed, we can 
use  finite-size  scaling to capture the behavior as the problem 
size grows,  as illustrated in  Figure 6(b).  The results in  Fig(cid:173)
ure 6 and the results in the previous section  indicate that the 
complexity of the subtour elimination algorithm goes hand-in-
hand with the constrainedness of the problem. 

Similar results have been reported in [26]. The results of this 
subsection extend that in [26] to different sizes of problems and 
by applying finite-size scaling to capture the threshold behav(cid:173)
ior as problem size increases. 

6  Conclusions and Discussions 
Our main contributions are twofold.  First, we provided strong 
positive evidences to the long-standing question of whether the 
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) has phase transitions [17]. 
We  studied  this  issue  on  the  more  general  asymmetric  TSP 
(ATSP). We empirically showed that many properties, includ(cid:173)
ing  the  ATSP  tour  cost  and  the  fraction  of backbone,  have

problem instances for the previous two figures. 

We now turn to the backbone of the ATSP, which is the frac(cid:173)
tion of directed arcs that appear in all  optimal solutions.  The 
backbones also exhibit phase transitions as the effective num(cid:173)
ber of digits for distances increases.  The result is included in 
Figure 5. Interestingly, the phase-transition pattern of the back(cid:173)
bone is almost identical to that of the fraction of distinct entities 
in the distance matrix, shown in Figure 1, and that of the ATSP 
tour cost, shown in Figure 2. 

The fraction of backbone captures, in essence, the tightness 
of the  constraints  among  the  cities.  As  more  intercity  dis(cid:173)
tances become distinct,  the number of tours of unique lengths 
increases.  Consequently, the number of optimal solutions de(cid:173)
creases and  the  fraction of backbone grows  inversely.  When 
more arcs are part of the backbone, optimal solutions become 
more restricted and the number of optimal solutions decreases, 
making it more difficult to find an optimal solution. 

4.3  Asymptotic  AP  precision 
As a  by-product of the phase-transition results,  we  now pro(cid:173)
vide asymptotic values of the ATSP cost,  the AP cost and its 
accuracy. We attempt to extend the previous theoretical results 
on the AP cost, which is known to be within (1.51,1.94)  [8], 
and the observation that the accuracy of the AP lower bounds 
increases as the problem size increases [1]. 

We need to be cautious in selecting the number of digits for 
intercity distances.  As discussed earlier,  the same number of 
digits for distances gives rise to different effective numbers of 
digits on problems of different sizes.  Therefore, the number of 
digits must be scaled properly to have the same effect on prob(cid:173)
lems of different sizes when we exam an asymptotic feature. 
Therefore,  in  our  experiments,  we  fixed the  scaled  effec(cid:173)
to  a constant.  Based  on  the  phase-

=  2  is  suf-

tive  number  of digits 
transition of the control parameter in Figure  1,  we took 

a  constant  of 2.

two  characteristically  different  values,  and  the  transitions  be-
tween  them  are  rather  abrupt  and  dramatic,  displaying phase-
transition phenomena. The control parameter of the phase tran(cid:173)
sitions  is  the  effective  number  of digits  representing the  inter(cid:173)
city  distances,  which  in  essence  measures the  precision of dis(cid:173)
tances.  Our  results  revealed  the  connection between  distance 
precision and phase transition properties in the ATSP.  Distance 
precision  is  the control parameter for various phase  transitions 
of  the  ATSP.  We  believe  that  the  concept  of precision  deter(cid:173)
mining  problem  properties  such  as  phase  transitions  is  rather 
universal  and  may  very  well  be  applicable  to  other problems, 
including  various scheduling and  planning problems. 

Second,  our  phase  transitions  results  provide  a  practical 
guidance  to  how  to  generate  difficult  random  ATSP  problem 
instances  and  which  instances  to  use  to  compare  the  asymp(cid:173)
totic  performance  of two  algorithms.  A  common  practice  in 
comparing  algorithms  when  using  a  random  ensemble  is  to 
generate problems with  a  fixed distance precision.  Our results 
imply  that  the  correct  way  is  to  use  problem  instances  of dif(cid:173)
ferent  sizes  that  have  the  same  or  similar  features  such  as  the 
same  fraction  of backbones.  This,  in  turn,  requires  to  increase 
the  number of digits  for  intercity  distances  as  the  problem  size 
grows.  We  believe  that  this  guidance  is  general  and  can  be 
applied to  other optimization  problems.
