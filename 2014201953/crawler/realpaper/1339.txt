Different  heuristics  may  be  used  to  improve  the 
the  search.  Some  of  these  heuristics

are  discussed  below. 

CI)  Assume  a  solution  is  found  and  turn  the  solution 
tower  90  degrees  clockwise  and  we  obtain  another  solu­
t i o n.  This  suggests  that  at  l e v el  1, 
do  not  r e a l ly  need  to  generate  twenty-four  nodes- 
Let 
us  assign  numbers  to  the  sides  of  a  cube  as  in  Figure

in  Figure  1,  we 

(3)  Construct  a  set,  or  sets,  of  production  rules 
which  can  be  used  to  perform  v a l id  transformations  of 
the  problem  representation  i n to  problem  solutions  or 
into  forms  from  which  solutions  can  be  easily  derived. 

(4)  Attempt  to  revise  the  production  rules, 
to  obtain 
an  optimal  set  of  r u l e s,  and  describe  them  a b s t r a c t l y, 
hopefully  in  some  computer  compatible  language. 

(5)  Apply  the  production  rules  to  a  problem  repre­
sentation  to  obtain  an  intermediate  representation 
from  which  solutions  can  be  more  easily  derived,  or 
when  possible, 

to  obtain  the  solutions  d i r e c t l y. 

If  necessary,  select  an  appropriate  search  pro­

cedure  and  apply  it  to  find  the  solutions.

It  becomes  apparent 
for  example,  with  Side  1,  Side

that  we  need  to  generate  only 

(2)  Before  s t a r t i ng  the  search  one  may  want  to  select 
the  cube  with  the  most  sides  in  one  color  and  place  it 
on  top  of  the  tower.  Following  t h i s,  one  attempts  to 
"hide"  the  dominant  colors  of  each  cube.  That  i s, 
each  cube  is  examined  to  determine  which  color, 
appears  most  often. 
if 
possible,  so  that  t h is  color  is  on  the  top  and  bottom 
of  the  cube.  Hence  the  dominant  color  i s,  in  a  sense, 
"hidden".  This  h e u r i s t ic  can  prevent  some  unnecessary 
searching  whenever  a  solution  e x i s t s. 

The  cube  is  then  positioned, 

if  any, 

O)  The  tree  searching  down  a  twig  may  be  halted  when­
ever  a  node  is  found  to  be  incompatible  with  a  solu­
t i o n.  That  i s,  no  further  searching  down  that  twig 
need  be  performed  if  two  cubes  having  the  same  color 
on  one  side  of  the  tower  are  found. 

(4)  Other  h e u r i s t i cs  may  also  be  used.  However,  when 
a  solution  does  not  e x i s t,  an  extensive  search  may  be 
required. 
If  the  puzzle  is  extended  by  the  addition 
of  more  cubes  and  colors  then  a  h e u r i s t ic  search  may 
s t i ll  be  i n t o l e r a b l e.  The  following  section  des­
cribes  an  algorithm  which  overcomes  some  of  the  prob­
lems  of  the  search  methods. 

I I I.  A  Number  Theory  Approach 

These  steps  are  clearly  interdependent.  The 
selection  of  a  notation  for  describing  the  problem 
w i ll  l i k e ly  enhance  or  i n h i b it 
the  optimization  of 
the  production  r u l e s,  and  the  successful  abstraction 
of  a  set  of  production  rules  can  make  the  search  pro­
cess  e f f i c i e nt  or  even  unnecessary.  The  tower  of 
cubes  puzzle  provides  an  excellent  example  of  a  suc­
cessful  application,  of  the  number  theory  approach. 
The  following  is  a  description  of  the  application  of 
this  approach  to  the  tower  of  cubes  puzzle-

To  begin  w i t h,  the  properties  of  a  problem  must  be

as  a  six-tuple  of  the  form  <front,  back, 
top,  bottom>.  Using  this  description, 
properties  are  noted. 

1.  Although  each  cube  is  described  as  a  s i x - t u p l e, 
the  description  of  a  solution  configuration  for  each 
cube  is  only  a  four-tuple  of  the  form  < f r o n t,  back, 
l e f t,  r i g h t >.  This  is  obvious  since  a  description  of 
the

should  be  noted  that  the  i n i t i al  description  of  a  cube 
must  contain  a  description  of  a ll  six  sides,  since  the 
<top,  bottom>  sides  may  be  rotated  into  the  position 
of  the  < f r o n t,  back>  or  < l e f t,  r i g h t>  sides. 

the  two  remaining  sides.  However, 

the  <top,  bottom>  sides  is  of  no  interest 

2.  The  Production  Rules.  A  series  of  simple  produc­
t i on  rules  may  be  used.  However,  it  should  be  noted 
that  these  rules  rely  on  the  p r i n c i p le

search  in  the  description  matrix  for  a  rearrangement 
of  the  description  matrix  such  that  the  above  equa(cid:173)

then 
no  solution  exists  for  the  given  puzzle.  Section  IV

If  one  f a i ls  to  f i nd  these  two 
there  is  no  solution  to  the  puzzle. 

f o u r - t u p l e s, 

then 

The  search  process  is  to 

f i nd  two  independent 
paths  from  the  top  row  to  the  bottom  row  in  the  des(cid:173)
c r i p t i on  matrix  such  that 
the  values  of  these  two 
paths  are  both  56.  A  path  is  defined  to  be  a  set 
containing  one  and  only  one  element  from  each  row  of 
the  description  matrix.  Paths  are  said  to  be  inde(cid:173)
pendent  if  they  are  mutually  exclusive  sets. 
The 
value  of  a  path  is  the  sum  of  the  values  of  the  e l e(cid:173)
ments  in  the  path. 

The  search  process 

in  the  description  matrix  w i ll 

involve  a  maximum  of  34  =  81  paths.  This  number  is 
considerably  smaller  than  the  maximum  numbers  of  paths 
that  may  be  involved  in  the  other  search  methods  des(cid:173)
cribed  in  Section  I I, 

Another  property  of  t h is  search  process 

that 

should  be  mentioned  is  that  a  node  is  simply  an  i n t e(cid:173)
ger  number  instead  of  a  s i x - t u p le  or  a  four-tuple  as 
in  the  search  methods  described  in  Section  I I.  Hence

performed  by  applying  appropriately  the  interchange-

fied  and  described  in  Theorem  1  below.  The  f i n al

the 
tower  w i ll  each  be  composed  of  2n  cube-sides  whose

Step  1;  Select  the  f i r st  available  ordered  pair  from 
A  and  c a ll  the  pair  a.  Call  the  r i g ht  element  in  a 
by  the  name  b.  Stop  if  A  is  empty.

available  ordered  pairs  in  A  including  the  pair  a.

Step  4:  The  other  b  may  be  in  either  the  l e ft  or  the

V.  Conclusion: 

As  Nileson  says,  "Research  on  solving  puzzles 

and  games  has  generated  and  refined  many  problem-solving 
ideas  that  are  also  genuinely  useful  on  less  f r i v o l o us 
tasks".  Puzzles  and  games  provide  a  r i ch  source  of 
example  problems  for  research  in  problem-solving.  Many 
researchers  such  as  Slagle  and  Greenblatt 
reported  on 
research  w i th  games  but  much  less  research  w i th  puzzles 
is 

reported.

The  tower  of  cubes  puzzle  with  four  cubes  and 

four  colors  is  by  no  means  a  p r o h i b i t i ve  puzzle  to  be 
solved  in  any  method  on  the  modem  computer.  How(cid:173)
ever, 
the  solution  of  a  generalized  tower  of  cubes 
puzzle  w i th  n  cubes  and  n  colors  rapidly  becomes  more 
and  more  time  consuming  as  n  gets  larger. 

As  discussed  in  t h is  paper, 

the  selection  of  a 
problem-solving  method  can  make  a  big  difference  in 
the  efficiency  of  the  problem  solution.  The  methods 
discussed  in  Section  II  are  rather  conventional  and 
are  used  to  i l l u s t r a te  the  effect  of 
the  differences 
in  solution  methods.  They  are  also  used  to  serve  as 
a  contrast  to  the  number  theory  approach  proposed  in 
Section  I I I. 
described  in  Section  I II 
solution  procedure  for  the  puzzle.  There  are  several 
other  very  e f f i c i e nt  methods.  The  Busacker-Saaty 
approach  which  makes  use  of  a  12-arc,  4-node  graph 
is  also  an  e f f i c i e nt  method. 
It  uses  a  search  for 
two  d i s j o i nt  subgraphs  having  certain  properties. 

It  should  be  noted  that
