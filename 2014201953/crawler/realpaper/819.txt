Abstract

Over  the  past  decade  functional  Magnetic  Reso-
nance Imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful 
technique  to  locate  activity  of  human  brain  while 
engaged in a particular task or cognitive state. We 
consider the inverse problem of detecting the cog-
nitive state of a human subject based on the fMRI 
data.  We  have  explored  classification  techniques 
such  as  Gaussian  Naive  Bayes,  k-Nearest 
Neighbour and Support Vector Machines. In order 
to reduce the very high dimensional fMRI data, we 
have  used  three  feature  selection  strategies.  Dis-
criminating  features  and  activity  based  features 
were  used  to  select  features  for  the  problem  of 
identifying  the  instantaneous  cognitive  state  given 
a  single  fMRI  scan  and  correlation  based  features 
were used when fMRI data from a single time in-
terval was given. A case study of visuo-motor se-
quence  learning  is  presented.  The  set  of  cognitive 
states we are interested in detecting are whether the 
subject has learnt a sequence, and if the subject is 
paying  attention  only  towards  the  position  or  to-
wards  both  the  color  and  position  of  the  visual 
stimuli.  We  have  successfully  used  correlation 
based features to detect position-color related cog-
nitive  states  with  80%  accuracy  and  the  cognitive 
states related to learning with 62.5% accuracy. 

1  Introduction 
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a power-
ful imaging tool, which can be used to perform brain activa-
tion studies my measuring Blood Oxygen Level Dependent 
(BOLD)  signal  [Ogawa  et  al.,  1990].  Human  brain  carries 
out  various  functions  at  a  time.  The  operations  within  the 
brain  like,  “the  process  of  thinking”  and  “the  process  of 
remembering”, that affect our mental contents are called as 
‘cognitive processes’ and the person is said to be in the par-
ticular ‘cognitive state’. Our aim is to identify the cognitive 
state  of  a  human  subject  that  is  persistent  within  a  certain 
interval of time, given the fMRI activity within that interval. 
Our  motivation  in  the  detection  of  cognitive  states  is  that 
this could lead to our understanding of the hidden cognitive 
states a human passes through while performing a particular 

task. This could have potential applications in Lie Detectors, 
Cognitive  control  of  artifacts,  Cognitive  control  of  mental 
states (Neurofeedback), etc. 

An fMRI scanner measures the value of the fMRI signal 
at all the points in a three dimensional grid, or image every 
few seconds (6 sec in our data). The voxels (volume pixels) 
in a typical fMRI study have a volume of a few tens of cubic 
millimeters and the 3D brain image contains 1,84,707 vox-
els that constitute the whole brain, thereby resulting in very 
high dimensional data. Since the signals measure tiny fluc-
tuations in the magnetic field, known as the Blood Oxygen 
Level Dependent (BOLD) response, the signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR) for fMRI data is very low. Thus the other characteris-
tic  of  fMRI  data  is  that  they  are  very  noisy.  This  problem 
domain is quite interesting from the Machine Learning per-
spective,  as  it  provides  a  case  study  of  classifier  learning 
from extremely high dimensional and noisy data. 

We borrow Mitchell’s [Mitchell, 1997] definition to state 
more  formally  the  problem  of  detection  of  cognitive  states 
from fMRI data.    
Definition:  A  computer  program  is  said  to  have  learned 
from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and 
performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as 
measured by P, improves with experience E. In our case,  
T: classification of cognitive state of human subject 
E: labelled training data mapping fMRI scans to the instan-
taneous cognitive state 
P:  performance  accuracy  of  the  algorithm  over  the  unseen 
fMRI data. 

The  case  study  in  this  paper  is  a  Visuomotor  sequence 
learning  experiment  [Miyapuram,  2004].  Human  Subjects 
perform a motor task (pressing a key on a keyboard) in re-
sponse  to visual  stimuli  (having position  and  colour  attrib-
utes). The problem that we have attempted in this study is to 
classify fMRI data into a discrete set of cognitive states that 
are  “subject  has  learnt  a  sequence”,  “subject  did  not  learn 
the sequence”, “the subject is paying attention only towards 
the position of the visual stimuli” and “the subject is paying 
attention  towards  the  color  and  the  position  of  the  visual 
stimuli”. The various machine learning algorithms we have 
applied on this fMRI data are Gaussian Naive Bayes Classi-
fier (GNB), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Support Vector 
Machines  (SVM).  To  deal  with  the  high  dimensionality  of 
the  data  we  have  used  three  feature  selection  strategies

Correlation based features. 

2  Materials and Methods 

2.1  Machine Learning Classifier Techniques  

A classifier is a function which takes input a set of exam-
ples and outputs a class label to each input example, where 
class label belongs to a discrete set of possible categories. In 
our case the classifier is a function of the form: 
f : fMRI-sequence(t1, t2)
where fMRI-sequence(t1, t2) is the sequence of fMRI images 
collected  during  the  contiguous  time  interval  [t1,  t2],  and 
where CognitiveState is the set of cognitive states to be dis-
criminated.

 CognitiveState 

We explored three classifier training methods: a Gaussian 
Naive Bayes (GNB), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), and linear 
Support  Vector  Machines  (SVM).  These  classifiers  were 
selected because they have been used successfully earlier by 
[Mitchell et al., 2003, 2004; Wang et al., 2004] for solving 
similar  problem  as  well  as  in  other  applications  involving 
high dimensional data. For example, Naive Bayes Classifi-
ers, kNN and SVM have all been used for text classification 
problems [Nigam et al., 2000], where the dimensionality of 
the data is approximately 105, corresponding to the natural 
language vocabulary. 

2.2 fMRI Task Procedure 
The  fMRI  experiment  consisted  of  a  visuomotor  sequence 
learning task. A set of two circles filled with different col-
ours (Yellow, Red, Green or Blue) appeared simultaneously 
at two distinct positions (Top, Bottom, Left, or Right) on a 
screen. The correct order of the sequence is to be learnt by 
trial  and  error  based  on  the  spatial  positions  of  the  visual 
stimuli. In one task (P2P), the response was required to be 
generated according to the position of the stimuli. In another 
task  (P2C)  the  subjects  had  to  respond  using  an  arbitrary 
rule with the following mapping: Green – Top, Red – Right, 
Blue – Bottom, and Yellow – Left. The entire sequence to 
be  learnt  consisted  of  six  such  sets.  Hence  this  sequence 
learning  task  is  called  a  2  x  6  task.  Subjects  continue  to 
practice the same sequence repeatedly for 4 sessions (6 se-
quence blocks, of 36 sec each, per session). Human brain is 
involved in many activities at a time. There are many back-
ground processes such as respiration, heart beat, mood, etc. 
that are not related to the task being performed. Hence fMRI 
studies  must  be  designed  to  quantify  relative  changes  in 
brain  activity.  For  this  purpose,  the  sequence  blocks  alter-
nated with baseline blocks (18 sec each) in which subjects 
performed  keypresses  (using  the  same  rule  as  in  sequence 
task)  viewing  visual  stimuli  presented  randomly  one  at  a 
time. 

2.3  Feature Selection and Data Abstraction 
Data preprocessing: The case studies involve fMRI data of 
five normal subjects. As shape and size of brain varies for 
each individual, images need to be transformed into the co-

ordinate  system  of  a  standard  brain.  This  transformation 
would help in standardization of reporting of co-ordinates of 
the brain space across different studies. To achieve this, two 
types  of  brain images  were  collected  for  each  subject. The 
first  type  of  image  referred  to  as  a  functional  image,  cap-
tures  brain  activation  via  the  BOLD  response.  The  second 
type of image, called the structural image, captures the static 
physical brain structure at higher resolution. First the struc-
tural images of all the subjects were standardized [Friston et 
al., 1995] to a template image and the resulting parameters 
were  used  for  standardizing  all  the  functional  images  of 
each subject to the template. The end result of this preproc-
essing  step  is  that  all  the  image  data  are  in  same  size  and 
approximately same shape.  

Data Abstraction: As we are interested in training classifi-
ers  that  work  across  subjects  and  as  the  strength  of  the 
BOLD  response  varies  from  subject  to  subject,  abstracting 
the data is very important. Hence we adopted a normaliza-
tion method in which the algorithm rescales the data in each 
scan of every subject such that the mean value of the result-
ing data is zero, i.e. 
Yt = (Xt – meanXt) / stdXt, t = 1 … n 
Where Xt's and Yt's are the data before and after normaliza-
tion,  respectively  and,  meanXt  and  stdXt  are  the  mean  and 
the standard deviation of Xt, respectively. 

The other approach for data abstraction is a method that 
takes the correlation of the selected features to transform the 
real image data.  

Feature  Selection:  Feature  selection,  as  a  preprocessing 
step  to  machine  learning,  is  effective  in  reducing  dimen-
sionality,  removing  irrelevant  data,  increasing  learning  ac-
curacy,  and  improving  result  comprehensibility.  However, 
the increase in the dimensionality of the data poses a severe 
challenge  to  many  existing  feature  selection  methods  with 
respect to efficiency and effectiveness. The enormity of data 
may cause serious problems to many machine learning algo-
rithms with respect to scalability and learning performance. 
For  example,  high  dimensional  data  (i.e.,  data  sets  with 
hundreds or thousands of features) can contain high degree 
of irrelevant and redundant information which may greatly 
degrade the performance of the learning algorithms. There-
fore, feature selection becomes very necessary for machine 
learning tasks when facing high dimensional data. The first 
two methods, i.e. Discrim and Active, are the same as used 
by [Mitchell et al., 2003, 2004; Wang et al., 2004]. 
Select the n most discriminating voxels (Discrim): In this 
method, voxels (features) are selected based on their ability 
to distinguish one target class from the other. 
Select the n most active voxels (Active): In this method, 
voxels are selected based on their ability to distinguish ei-
ther target class from the baseline condition.  
Select  the  n  feature  pairs  whose  correlation  discrimi-
nates  the  target  classes (CorrPair):  This  technique  is  in-
spired from the feature selection algorithm Corona [Yang et 
al.,  2005]  which  uses  correlation  information  among  fea-
tures  to  select  them.  Traditional  feature  subset  selection

techniques  such  as  Recursive  Feature  Elimination  [Am-
broise  and  McLachlan,  2002]  and  Fast  Correlation  Based 
Filter  (FCBF)  [Yu  and  Liu,  2003]  lose  this  information  as 
they  use  the  feature  data  only.  In  this  method,  voxel  pairs 
are  selected  based  on  their  ability  discriminate  the  target 
classes.  The  correlation  value  between  these  voxel  pairs  is 
then used as feature vector to train the classifiers.  

3  Case Study  
Our case study involves fMRI data collected when subjects 
are enagaged in visuo-motor sequence learning experiments. 
In these experiments, subjects learn the correct  sequence of 
response by trial and error and continue to perform it until 
the end of the experiment. Therefore there are task–related 
changes at the neuronal level occurring continuously in dif-
ferent  areas  of  the  brain.  These  changes  are  reflected  as 
changes in the activity at different voxels in fMRI images.  

3.1 P2P Vs P2C Classification Study 
Firstly, we have considered the problem of training classifi-
ers to detect the cognitive states, “the subject is paying at-
tention only towards the position of the visual stimuli” and 
“the  subject  is  paying  attention  towards  the  color  and  the 
position of the visual stimuli”. When the subject is perform-
ing  the  P2P  task  he  pays  attention  towards  the  position  of 
the visual stimuli and responds only according to the posi-
tion  of  the  stimuli,  the  color  of  the  stimuli  is  irrelevant. 
Whereas  when  the  subject  is  performing  the  P2C  task  he 
pays attention towards the position of the visual stimuli and 
responds  according  to  the  color  of  the  stimuli.  Hence  the 
essential  difference  between  these  two  tasks  is  the  way  in 
which the response is generated after seeing the position of 
the visual stimuli.

subject classification are shown in Table 1.  

For multiple subjects, the detection of instantaneous cog-
nitive  state  using  Discrim  and  Active  features  was  below 
random classification. We have successfully used the corre-
lation based feature selection to train the classifier function 
of the form f: <I1 … It>  CognitiveState where <I1 … It>
is a set of fMRI scans taken in a time interval of length t and 
CognitiveState takes on values P2P and P2C.

The assumption here is that since the set of brain areas un-
derlying spatial and color perception are distinct, the cogni-
tive  states  reflecting  the  two  tasks  can  be  distinguished 
based on the fMRI signals. 

In this particular case study we have tried to capture this 
difference in our classifier function. We have used the Dis-
criminating  features  and  Active  feature  selection  strategies 

All  three  classifiers,  GNB,  kNN  and  SVM  have  per-
formed successfully and have given much better results than 
random-chance  classification.  Using  the  CorrPair  (t=72) 
feature selection method gave the optimal results where the 
number of features is 474 and the number training samples 
were 16. The results show the superior performance of GNB 
and kNN (k=9) classifiers over the SVM.  

3.2 Early Vs Late Learning Study 
In  the  second  phase,  we  have  considered  the  problem  of 
training classifiers to detect the cognitive states, “subject has 
learnt  the  sequence  (Late  stage  where  the  performance  is 
smooth  and  automatic)”  and  “subject  did  not  learn  the  se-
quence (Early stage where the performance is deliberate and 
error-prone).” In both the tasks, P2P and P2C, the subjects

have to learn the position sequences (or the order in which 
to  press  on  the  keypad,  given  the  visual  stimuli).  This  se-
quence is learnt by a process of trail and error.

In this case study we try to detect whether the subject has 
learnt the sequence or not, irrespective of the task he is per-
forming. It is to be noted that this classification task is po-
tentially more difficult than the earlier one. The assumption 
here is that the brain processes related to early learning are 
distinguishable from those engaged in the later part. Further, 
it is also assumed that the cognitive states corresponding to 
the two learning stages are similar across the P2P and P2C 
tasks.  We  have  used  the  Discriminating  features  and  the 
Activity based feature selection methods to find a classifica-
CognitiveState where It is a 
tion function of the form f : It
fMRI scan at a single time instance and CognitiveState takes 
values as either “Early Learning” or “Late Learning”. As in 
previous  case  study,  we  were  successful  in  training  single 
subject classifiers.

We obtained less than random classification for multiple 

subject classifications using Discrim and Active features.  
We  have  successfully  used  the  correlation  based  feature 
selection to train the classifier function of the form  
f: < I1 … It >  CognitiveState, where < I1 … It > is a set of 
fMRI scans taken in a time interval of length t and Cogni-
tiveState  takes  on  values  —  “Early  Learning”  or  “Late 
Learning”.  

Table 4 shows the results of using correlation based fea-
ture  selection  technique  where  the  average accuracy of  the 
multiple subject classifier is above that of a random classi-
fier,  for  t  taking  values  12,  36  and  72.  The  “leave-one-
subject-out” strategy was used for training multiple-subject 
classifiers.

All  three  classifiers,  GNB,  kNN  (k=9)  have  performed 
satisfactorily  and  have  given  better  results  than  random 
classification,  whereas  the  performance  of  the  SVM  was 
very  poor.  Using  the  CorrPair  (t=36)  feature  selection 
method  gave  the  optimal  results  where  the  number  of  fea-
tures  is  445  and  the  number  of  training  samples  were  32. 
The  results  show  the  superior  performance  of  GNB  and 
kNN (k=9) classifiers over the SVM.  

One important point that we have noticed is that the over-
all  performance  of  the  multi-subject  classifier  in  this  case 
study has decreased as compared to the “P2P Vs P2C” case 
study. One possible reason for this could be that that differ-
ent  subjects  learn  the  sequence  at  different  rates.  For  this 
purpose,  we  have  designated  the  first  two  sessions  of  the 
experiment as the “Early Learning” period and the last two 
sessions as the “Late Learning” period. This criterion might 
not efficiently account for the subjective variations.  

4  Discussion  

The  field  of  machine  learning  techniques  for  classifica-
tion of data is very huge. We have tried a number of differ-
ent  techniques  [Singh,  2005]  that  are  suited  for  the  high 
dimensional data of fMRI. The paper has taken up as a case 
study  data  from  a  real  fMRI  experiment  employing  visuo-
motor sequence learning task. Here the present state of brain 
is a function of its previous states and the present input (vis-
ual stimuli), a function which is unknown. Hence classifica-
tion in such a dynamically varying situation is a very chal-
lenging. The learning task in this paper is inherently differ-
ent from previous case studies of [Wang et al., 2004], such 
as the Picture Vs Sentence Study, in which the present state 
of the brain is just a function of its present input (picture & 
sentence). As with any cognitive experiments, there will be 
overlapping and distinct brain areas associated with the re-
spective cognitive processes – position and  colour process-
ing in our case studies. As the focus of the present paper is 
detection  of  cognitive  states,  comparision  of  our  results  to 
the literature in cognitive neuroscience is beyond the scope.

Problems  related  to  artifacts  in  data  have  been  dealt  with 
appropriate  preprocessing  techniques  commonly  used  for 
FMRI data. The additional challenge posed by this data was 
feature selection. Hence, we have focused on comparison of 
different classifiers and also the feature selection strategies. 
The three difficulties namely, ‘high dimensionality', `differ-
ent shapes & sizes of the brain' and `variations in the activ-
ity level across subjects', are the major reasons for the supe-
rior performance of the single-subject classifiers over multi-
subject  classifiers  and  are  primary  hurdles  in  the  `feature 
selection problem'. 

The existing feature selection algorithms, like FCBF and 
Corona,  could  not  be  implemented  in  such  a  high  dimen-
sional  feature  space.  Hence  we  had  to  opt  the  strategies 
which were described earlier in the section 2. The drawback 
of these strategies is that we do not know the optimal num-
ber of  features  to  select,  and  hence  we have  to  do  a  lot  of 
trial and error until we get good result or we conclude that 
we  cannot  get  any  better  result  further.  In  spite  of  these 
drawbacks, the correlation based strategies outperformed the  
activity  based  or  discriminating  feature  selection  methods 
when  tested  across  subjects.  Also,  this  can  be  successfully 
used in the absence of a domain expert, who identifies the 
regions  of  interest  (ROI’s)  in  the  human  brain  given  the 
nature of the task and reduces the need of feature selection. 

The  reason  for  the  better  performance  of  the  correlation 
based  features  as  compared  to  the  Discriminating  features 
and the Activity based features in the multi-subject classifier 
training  scenario  is  that  they  are  not  using  the  voxel  (fea-
ture)  activity  values  directly  as  feature  vector  to  train  the 
classifiers, instead they are abstracting the voxel values and 
using the correlation between the voxels as the feature vec-
tor for training, hence the problem of variations in the activ-
ity level across subjects is addressed. Whereas the Discrimi-
nating features and the Activity based features use the voxel 
activity values directly as features to train the classifiers and 
face  the  problem  of  difference  in  the  activity  levels  across 
the subjects.  

The  results  showed  superior  performance  of  GNB  and 
kNN over the SVM. This was similar to Semantic Category 
Study of [Mitchell et al., 2003] where the number of train-
ing samples per class was very less (10). This is quiet oppo-
site  to  the  results  obtained  in  the  Picture  versus  Sentence 
study, where the number of training samples per class was 
40 and the SVM out-performed the GNB and kNN. So we 
speculate that when the training samples are small in num-
ber GNB out-performs SVM.  

5  Conclusions  
The  results  obtained  in  the  two  case  studies,  i.e.,  “P2P  Vs 
P2C Study” and “Early Vs Late Learning Study”, prove that 
the  problem  of  detection of  cognitive  states  in  such  a high 
dimensional  feature  space  is  feasible  when  right  choice  of 
features  is  made  along  with  methods  to  abstract  data    As 
future work to this project we suggest the following:  
1. The problem  of  multiple  subject  classifiers  learning  to 

detect the instantaneous cognitive states.  

2. Finding  new  future  selection  methods  for  such  a  high
