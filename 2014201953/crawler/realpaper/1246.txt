These  r e s u l ts  suggested  t h at  when  t i ne  delays 

are  necessarily  present  the  human  operator  should 
not  c o n t r ol  in  a  continuous  closed  loop  but  should

manipulator  would  then  be  under  control  of  a  l o c al 
computer  e l i m i n a t i ng  s t a b i l i ty  problems.  Moreover, 
the  completion  time  would  become  f ar  less  s e n s i t i ve

number  of  waits

Such  a  system  is  i l l u s t r a t ed  in  F i o.  1.  A 

laboratory  simulation  has  been  implemented  c o n s i s t­
ing  of  an  American  Machine  and  Foundry  Model  8 
master-slave  manipulator  driven  bv  stepping  motors 
through  an  augmented  PDP-8  computer.

The  human  supervisor  may  issue  h is  commands 

to  those  of 

f or  the  human  operator 

as  s t r i n gs  of  alphanumeric  characters  through  a 
conventional  teletype  as  in  F i g.  2a  (such  commands 
we  c a ll  "symbolic  commands").  He  may  also  i n d i c a te 
d i r e c t i o n,  magnitude,  and  time  through  moving  a 
multi-degree-of-freedom  j o y s t i ck  which  may  even 
have  a r t i c u l a t i o ns  corresponding 
the 
manipulator  (these  we  c a ll  "analogic  commands"). 
Experiments  by  Verplank9  with  a  device  shown  in 
F i g.  2b  suggest  it  is  quicker  and  c e r t a i n ly  more 
n a t u r al 
to 
the  computer  c e r t a in  movements  or  positions  by  the 
analogic  mode  than  symbolicallv.  This  is  true  even 
if 
switches 
for  each  a r t i c u l a t i on  so  t h at  the  operator 
must  himself  adjust  h is  arm  and  body  to  achieve  the 
p o s i t i on  correspondence.  Conceivably  the  analogic 
c o n t r ol  could  also  take  the  form  of  a  scaled  p h y s i­
cal  model  of  the  manipulator  in  a  model  of  the 
task 
environment.  The  human  operator*s  goals  could  then 
be  communicated  to  the  computer  bv  h is  manual  rear­
rangement  of  the  model.

Even  the  crudest  of  t a c t i le  sensors  such  as

a  simple  e l e c t r i c al  contact  is  useful 
t i c a l ly  stopping  the  arm  motion  if  an  object  is

Command  Language 

In  order  to  develop,  o n - l i n e, 

the  commands 
from  a  small  set 

It  accepts 

appropriate  to  a  p a r t i c u l ar  task 
of  p r i m i t i ve  commands,  a  simple  compiler  called 
MANTRAN  has  been  w r i t t en  by  Barber.10 
tvped  commands  to  the  manipulator  to  move  at  a  spec­
i f i ed  rate  to  a  specified  p o s i t i on  or  in  a  specified 
d i r e c t i on  u n t il  c e r t a in  specified  conditions  occur, 
allowing  the  operator  to  combine  these  i n to  " p r o­
grams"  that  can  be  c a l l ed  by  name.  Such  programs 
may  have  w i t h in  them  various  searching  or  grasping 
or  emergency  c o n d i t i o n al  subroutines.  A  simple  but 
useful  mode  is  to  be  able  to  assign  a  name  to  a  g i v­
en  manipulator  configuration 
(simultaneous  set  of 
r e l a t i ve  positions  or  angles  at  each  a r t i c u l a t i o n) 
and  at  some  a r b i t r a ry  time 
configuration  name  and  have  the  manipulator  auto­
m a t i c a l ly  return  t h e r e.  This  r e n u i r e s,  of  course, 
t h at  the  computer  maintain  a  state  vector 
for  the 
current  manipulator  configuration  with  which 
pare  the  stored  state  vector  corresponding 
named  c o n f i g u r a t i o n.  A l t e r n a t i v e l y, 
be  commanded  to  respond  to  the  analogic  c o n t r o l l er 
u n t il  c e r t a in  positions  are  obtained  or  u n t il 
hand  contacts  an  o b j e c t,  at  which  time  the  program 
branches  out  of  the  analooic  mode.  An  example  of 
MANTRAN  is  shown  in  F i g.  4.

human  operators  and  computers  can  i n t e r a ct  in  plan-

presented  bv  example. 

F i g.  6  represents  a  manipulation  task  in  a

jaws  J  and  J1  and  the  blocks  A  and  B  are  each  one 
u n it  on  a  side  and  a ll  moves  of  blocks  and  jaws  must 
be  an  integer  number  of  u n i ts  in  extent.  The  qoal 
is  to  move  the  jaws  so  as  to  get  block  A  to  square 
A1.  Neither  blocks  nor  jaws  can  occupy  a  cross-
hatched  square  ( w a l l ).  The  jaws  move  h o r i z o n t a l lv 
as  one,  and  v e r t i c a l ly  J*  moves  r e l a t i ve  to  J  over 
four  spaces  from  closed  to  wide  open  (they  are  i l l u s­
trated  one  space  open)•  The  jaws  can  grasp  a  block 
or  push  i t; 
jaws  must 
f i r st  straddle  it  w i th  one  u n it  space  on  each  side. 

in  order  to  grasp  a  block  the

various  ways  to  perform  tasks  such  as  the  one  in 
our  example.  The  functions  and  tests  are  organized

tasks  (move  A  to  A1,  then  to  A2,  then  to  A3,  then 
to  A ' ).  The  subgoals  are  achieved  at  the  slash 
marks  in  the  subroutine  sequence.  This  series  of

to  set  a  new  subgoal  A3  to  which  A  can  be  pushed  and 
then  grasped  or  pushed  to  A*. 
If  the  human  operator 
had  thought  ahead  he  would  have  set  A4  and  A5  as 
subgoals,  and  as  indicated  a  shorter  s t r i ng  or

As  a  f u r t h er  example  of  how  the  operator  can 
d e l i m it  the  state  space,  suppose  for  task  element  8 
he  recognized  that  from  A1  or  A4  to  A2  or  A5  the 
jaws  would  have  to  be  closed.  Then  the  state  space 
f or  t h is  p o r t i on  of  the 
block  A  over  a  7.2  g r id  and  the  jaws  J  over  a  7.1

jawed  over  the  g r id  B  wide  and  ten  high  at  the  l e ft 
for  the  A  to  A1  or  A4  subtask  and  a  over  a  g r id

This  then  renuires  a  state  space  (4»3*10*3-10)  +

the  state  space  techniques  when  the  nhvsical  space 
is  more 

f i n e ly  r e t i c u l a t ed  due  to  the 

r u le  stated  above.  Heuristic  techniques  are  by 
nature  context  dependent  and  not  much  generaliza­
t i on  can  be  made. 

Conclusion 

A  laboratory  simulation  and  some  empirical 

evidence  have  been  described  which  demonstrate  the 
advantages  of  havinq  human  operators  operate  as 
supervisory  c o n t r o l l e rs  of  remote  computer-manipu­
l a t o r s,  where  the  man  sets  subqoals  and  sets  pro­
cedural  constraints  and  the  machine  does  the  rest 
automatically.  Many  p r a c t i c al  advantages  of  such 
man-machine  i n t e r a c t i ve  systems  are 
speed  UD  remote  or  monotonous  tasks,  avoid  the  costs 
and  r i s ks  of  supporting  man  in  hazardous  environ­
ments,  and  provide  a  true  f l e x i b i l i tv  of  explora­
t i on  and  manipulation  not  near  to  achievement  by 
completely  autonomous  machines.
